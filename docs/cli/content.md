# Content Commands

Commands for working with Page Designer content libraries and metadefinitions.

## Authentication

The `content export` and `content list` commands require OAuth authentication:

| Operation | Auth Required |
|-----------|--------------|
| `content export` | OAuth (OCAPI for export job + WebDAV for assets) |
| `content list` | OAuth (OCAPI for export job) |
| `content validate` | None (local file validation) |

```bash
export SFCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

The `content export` and `content list` commands also support a `--library-file` flag for offline use with a local XML file, which skips authentication entirely.

For complete setup instructions, see the [Authentication Guide](/guide/authentication).

---

## b2c content export

Export Page Designer pages with their component trees and static assets from a content library.

The command fetches the library XML from the instance (via a site archive export job), parses the page/component tree structure, filters by the specified page IDs, downloads referenced static assets via WebDAV, and writes the result to a local directory as a re-importable site archive.

### Usage

```bash
b2c content export [PAGES...] --library <library-id>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `PAGES` | One or more content IDs to export (pages, content assets, components, or content blocks) | Yes |

### Flags

In addition to [global flags](./index#global-flags):

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--library` | Library ID or site ID. Also configurable via `content-library` in dw.json. | |
| `--output`, `-o` | Output directory | `content-<timestamp>` |
| `--site-library` / `--no-site-library` | Treat the library as a site-private library. Defaults from a matching `libraries` config entry, otherwise `false` | from config |
| `--asset-query`, `-q` | JSON dot-paths for static asset extraction (can be repeated) | `image.path` |
| `--regex`, `-r` | Treat page IDs as regular expressions | `false` |
| `--folder` | Filter by folder classification (can be repeated) | |
| `--offline` | Skip asset downloads | `false` |
| `--library-file` | Use a local library XML file instead of fetching from instance | |
| `--keep-orphans` | Include orphan components (not linked to any page) in export | `false` |
| `--show-tree` | Display tree structure of exported content | `true` |
| `--timeout` | Export job timeout in seconds | |
| `--dry-run` | Preview export without downloading assets or writing files | `false` |

### Examples

```bash
# Export a single page from a shared library
b2c content export homepage --library SharedLibrary --server my-sandbox.demandware.net

# Export multiple pages
b2c content export homepage about-us contact --library SharedLibrary

# Export pages matching a regex pattern
b2c content export "hero-.*" "promo-.*" --library SharedLibrary --regex

# Export a specific component by ID
b2c content export hero-banner --library SharedLibrary

# Export from a site-private library
b2c content export homepage --library RefArch --site-library -o ./export

# Preview what would be exported without downloading
b2c content export homepage --library SharedLibrary --dry-run

# Export with JSON output
b2c content export homepage --library SharedLibrary --json

# Export from a local XML file (no instance connection needed)
b2c content export homepage --library SharedLibrary --library-file ./library.xml --offline

# Filter by folder classification
b2c content export homepage --library SharedLibrary --folder seasonal --folder holiday

# Custom asset extraction paths
b2c content export homepage --library SharedLibrary -q "image.path" -q "video.url"

# Using environment variables and dw.json config
export SFCC_SERVER=my-sandbox.demandware.net
export SFCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
b2c content export homepage

# With a libraries config entry (see below) marking the site library as
# site-private, --site-library is inferred automatically:
b2c content export homepage --library SiteGenesis
```

### Configuring multiple libraries

Listing libraries under `b2c.libraries` in `package.json` (or `libraries` in `dw.json`) lets the CLI pick a default library and infer `--site-library` per entry. Bare strings are shared libraries; `{id, siteLibrary: true}` marks a site-private library. Both forms can be mixed:

```json
{
  "b2c": {
    "libraries": [
      "RefArchSharedLibrary",
      { "id": "SiteGenesis", "siteLibrary": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

With this config:

```bash
# Uses RefArchSharedLibrary (first entry) as the default library
b2c content export hero-banner

# --site-library is inferred from the matching entry
b2c content export homepage --library SiteGenesis

# Explicit flag still overrides the config
b2c content export homepage --library SiteGenesis --no-site-library
```

### Output

The command displays:

1. A tree visualization of the exported content (pages, components, content blocks, and assets)
2. Asset download progress with success/failure indicators
3. A summary line listing counts by type, e.g.: `Exported: 2 pages, 1 content asset, 5 components, 1 content block, 3 static assets to ./export`

With `--json`, returns a structured result including the library tree, output path, downloaded/failed asset lists, and counts.

### Notes

- The `--library` flag can be set in `dw.json` as `content-library` or in `package.json` under `b2c.contentLibrary` to avoid passing it every time. You can also list libraries under `b2c.libraries` (mixed strings or `{id, siteLibrary?}` objects); when the resolved library matches an entry marked `siteLibrary: true`, `--site-library` defaults to true automatically. The CLI flag still wins when passed explicitly
- Use `b2c content list` to discover available page IDs before exporting
- You can export pages, content assets, individual components, or content blocks by their content ID. When a component or content-block ID is specified, it is promoted to the root of the export with its full child tree
- **Content blocks** are Page Designer "content blocks" — reusable `fragment.*`-typed content shared across pages. They are listed distinctly in the tree as `(CONTENT BLOCK)` and counted separately in the summary. A content block can be exported by its ID just like a component; a Layout content block retains its region children
- The `--asset-query` flag specifies JSON dot-notation paths within component data to extract static asset references. The default `image.path` covers the common Page Designer image component pattern
- Use `*` in asset query paths to traverse arrays (e.g., `slides.*.image.path`)

## b2c content list

List pages and content items in a content library. Useful for discovering page IDs before running an export.

### Usage

```bash
b2c content list --library <library-id>
```

### Flags

In addition to [global flags](./index#global-flags):

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--library` | Library ID or site ID. Also configurable via `content-library` in dw.json. | |
| `--site-library` / `--no-site-library` | Treat the library as a site-private library. Defaults from a matching `libraries` config entry, otherwise `false` | from config |
| `--library-file` | Use a local library XML file instead of fetching from instance | |
| `--type` | Filter by node type: `page`, `content`, `component`, or `fragment` (content blocks) | |
| `--components` | Include components in table output | `false` |
| `--tree` | Show tree structure instead of table | `false` |
| `--timeout` | Job timeout in seconds | |
| `--columns`, `-c` | Columns to display (comma-separated). Available: id, type, typeId, children | All columns |
| `--extended`, `-x` | Show all columns including extended fields | `false` |

### Examples

```bash
# List all content in a library
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --server my-sandbox.demandware.net

# List only pages
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --type page

# List only content blocks (the deduplicated catalog, including unlinked blocks)
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --type fragment

# List including components
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --components

# Show tree structure
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --tree

# List from a site-private library
b2c content list --library RefArch --site-library

# With a libraries config entry marking the site library as site-private,
# --site-library is inferred automatically (see "b2c content export"
# above for an example b2c.libraries config):
b2c content list --library SiteGenesis

# List from a local XML file
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --library-file ./library.xml

# JSON output
b2c content list --library SharedLibrary --json
```

### Output

Default table output:

```
ID               TYPE        TYPE ID            CHILDREN
homepage         PAGE        page.storePage     5
about-us         PAGE        page.storePage     3
footer           CONTENT                        2
```

With `--components`, components are included in the table output alongside pages and content items.

With `--tree`, displays a hierarchical tree visualization:

```
homepage (typeId: page.storePage)
├── component.heroBanner (hero-banner)
│   └── /images/hero.jpg (STATIC ASSET)
└── component.productGrid (product-grid)
about-us (typeId: page.storePage)
└── component.textBlock (text-block)
    └── /images/about.png (STATIC ASSET)
footer-content (CONTENT ASSET)
```

Pages show `id (typeId: type)`, components show `typeId (id)`, content blocks show `displayName (CONTENT BLOCK: typeId)`, content assets show `id (CONTENT ASSET)`, and static assets show `path (STATIC ASSET)`. The tree uses color when output to a terminal: page names are bold, component type IDs are cyan, content-block names are magenta, asset paths are green, and tree connectors are dim.

> **Content blocks** (`fragment.*`-typed content) are reusable, shared singletons. `--type fragment` lists the deduplicated catalog of all content blocks in the library (including blocks not currently linked to any page), since they are not root-level content items.

With `--json`, returns `{ data: [...] }` with each item containing `id`, `type`, `typeId`, and `children` count.

## b2c content validate

Validate Page Designer metadefinition JSON files against schemas. This is a local-only command — no instance connection or authentication is required.

The command auto-detects the schema type using file path conventions (`experience/pages/` → pagetype, `experience/components/` → componenttype) and falls back to inspecting the JSON properties. You can also specify the type explicitly with `--type`.

### Usage

```bash
b2c content validate <files...>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `files` | One or more file paths, directories, or glob patterns | Yes |

When a directory is passed, all `*.json` files within it are validated recursively.

### Flags

In addition to [global flags](./index#global-flags):

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--type`, `-t` | Schema type to validate against (skips auto-detection) | Auto-detected |

Available schema types: `pagetype`, `componenttype`, `aspecttype`, `cmsrecord`, `customeditortype`, `contentassetpageconfig`, `contentassetcomponentconfig`, `contentassetstructuredcontentdata`, `image`.

### Examples

```bash
# Validate a single page type definition
b2c content validate cartridge/experience/pages/storePage.json

# Validate all metadefinitions in a directory recursively
b2c content validate cartridge/experience/

# Validate with a glob pattern
b2c content validate 'cartridge/experience/**/*.json'

# Explicitly specify the schema type
b2c content validate --type componenttype mycomponent.json

# Validate multiple files
b2c content validate pages/home.json pages/about.json components/hero.json

# JSON output for CI/scripting
b2c content validate cartridge/experience/ --json
```

### Output

The command prints a color-coded result for each file:

```
PASS: experience/pages/storePage.json (pagetype)
PASS: experience/components/hero.json (componenttype)
FAIL: experience/components/broken.json (componenttype)
  ERROR at .attribute_definition_groups[0]: is required

2/3 file(s) valid, 1 error(s)
```

The command exits with a non-zero status when any file fails validation.

With `--json`, returns a structured result:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "valid": true,
      "schemaType": "pagetype",
      "errors": [],
      "filePath": "/path/to/storePage.json"
    }
  ],
  "totalFiles": 1,
  "validFiles": 1,
  "totalErrors": 0
}
```

### Notes

- Auto-detection uses file path conventions first: files under `experience/pages/` are validated as `pagetype`, files under `experience/components/` as `componenttype`. For other schema types, use `--type`.
- Schemas are bundled with the SDK and follow the [Page Designer metadefinition specification](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/guide/b2c-page-designer.html).
- Use `b2c content validate` in CI pipelines to catch metadefinition errors before deployment.

name: b2c-job
description: Run and monitor jobs on B2C Commerce instances using the b2c CLI, including individual site archive imports and exports and search indexing. Use this skill whenever the user needs to trigger an existing job, import a single site archive, export site data, rebuild search indexes, check job status, or troubleshoot a failed job execution — even if they just say "run this job", "import this archive", or "rebuild the search index".

# B2C Job Skill

Use the `b2c` CLI plugin to **run existing jobs** and import/export site archives on Salesforce B2C Commerce instances.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli job run`).

> **Creating a new job?** If you need to write custom job step _code_ (batch processing, scheduled tasks, data sync) **or author the `jobs.xml` job definition** that makes a job exist (so it can be run/scheduled), use the `b2c:b2c-custom-job-steps` skill — see its [jobs.xml Reference](../../../b2c/skills/b2c-custom-job-steps/references/JOBS-XML.md). `b2c job run` only executes jobs that already exist on the instance.

## Configuration & Authentication

The CLI auto-discovers the target instance and credentials from `SFCC_*` environment variables, `dw.json` in the current or parent directories, `~/.mobify`, `package.json`, and configuration plugins. **Flags like `--server`, `--client-id`, and `--client-secret` are usually unnecessary** — only pass them to override what's auto-detected.

Run `b2c setup inspect` to see the resolved configuration and which source provided each value (use `--json` for scripting, `--unmask` to reveal secrets). For precedence rules and troubleshooting, see the `b2c-cli:b2c-config` skill.

## Examples

### Run a Job

```bash
# run a job and return immediately
b2c job run my-custom-job

# run a job and wait for completion
b2c job run my-custom-job --wait

# run a job with a timeout (in seconds)
b2c job run my-custom-job --wait --timeout 600

# run a job with parameters (standard jobs)
b2c job run my-custom-job -P "SiteScope={\"all_storefront_sites\":true}" -P OtherParam=value

# show job log if the job fails
b2c job run my-custom-job --wait --show-log
```

### Run System Jobs with Custom Request Bodies

Some system jobs (like search indexing) use non-standard request schemas. Use `--body` to provide a raw JSON request body:

```bash
# run search index job for specific sites
b2c job run sfcc-search-index-product-full-update --wait --body '{"site_scope":{"named_sites":["RefArch","SiteGenesis"]}}'

# run search index job for a single site
b2c job run sfcc-search-index-product-full-update --wait --body '{"site_scope":{"named_sites":["RefArch"]}}'
```

Note: `--body` and `-P` are mutually exclusive.

### Standard (System) Job Steps

B2C Commerce ships a catalog of **standard job steps** — built-in step **type IDs** (for example `ImportCatalog`, `ExportCatalog`, `ImportInventoryLists`) that are added to job flows in **Business Manager → Administration → Operations → Jobs**, or referenced by type ID in a `jobs.xml` flow inside a site-import archive. They are the building blocks of the multi-step jobs you run with `b2c job run`.

Look up the catalog and any step's configuration parameters via the `b2c-cli:b2c-docs` skill — these docs are bundled with the CLI, so no instance connection is needed:

```bash
# Browse the standard step catalog
b2c docs read job-steps

# Look up a specific step's purpose + parameters
b2c docs read ImportCatalog
b2c docs search "export inventory"
```

**In-flow standard step vs. CLI command.** Some standard steps overlap with CLI commands — for instance, the standard catalog/site import steps vs. `b2c job import` (which itself runs the `sfcc-site-archive-import` system job). Use an **in-flow standard step** when the file is already staged on the instance or produced by an earlier step in the same flow (no round-trip, runs on a BM schedule). Use the **CLI** when moving data between your machine and the instance (uploading a local archive, downloading an export, or scripting from CI). For chaining custom + standard steps and IMPEX file hand-off, see the `b2c:b2c-custom-job-steps` skill.

### Import Site Archives

The `job import` command waits for the import job to complete by default. The same command imports a **job definition** (`jobs.xml` at the archive root) that registers a new runnable job on the instance — for the `jobs.xml` structure (job/flow/step, step `type`, the required `<triggers>` element), see the [jobs.xml Reference](../../../b2c/skills/b2c-custom-job-steps/references/JOBS-XML.md).

```bash
# import a local directory as a site archive (waits for completion by default)
b2c job import ./my-site-data

# import a local zip file
b2c job import ./export.zip

# import and return immediately without waiting for completion
b2c job import ./my-site-data --no-wait

# keep the archive on the instance after import
b2c job import ./my-site-data --keep-archive

# import an archive that already exists on the instance (in Impex/src/instance/)
b2c job import existing-archive.zip --remote

# show job log on failure
b2c job import ./my-site-data --show-log

# import only a subset of a directory (extra positionals are paths/globs
# resolved against the directory; preserves layout inside the archive)
b2c job import ./my-site-data sites/RefArch libraries/mylib
b2c job import ./my-site-data 'libraries/**'
```

### Import Sets

`job import-set` first applies site import/export archives from discovered cartridge `metadata/` sources, then applies archives in `./migrations`, and skips archives already recorded on the target instance:

```bash
b2c job import-set --dry-run
b2c job import-set
b2c job import-set --no-cartridge-metadata # only use ./migrations
b2c job import-set --import-set-exclude fixtures # ignore this project subtree
```

`--import-set-exclude` can be repeated or comma-separated and can also be configured as `b2c.importSetExclude` in `package.json`, `import-set-exclude` in `dw.json`, or `SFCC_IMPORT_SET_EXCLUDE`. For the full migration workflow — archive layouts, timestamp naming, post-import README notes, retry behavior, reset options, concurrency, and recovery — use the `b2c-cli:b2c-import-set-migrations` skill.

### Export Site Archives

The `job export` command exports data from a B2C Commerce instance as a site archive. You must specify at least one data unit to export.

```bash
# export global metadata
b2c job export --global-data meta_data

# export multiple global data units
b2c job export --global-data meta_data,custom_types,locales

# export a site with all site data
b2c job export --site RefArch

# export a site with specific site data units
b2c job export --site RefArch --site-data content,site_preferences

# export multiple sites
b2c job export --site RefArch --site SiteGenesis --site-data campaigns_and_promotions

# export catalogs
b2c job export --catalog storefront-catalog
b2c job export --catalog storefront-catalog,electronics-catalog

# export libraries
b2c job export --library RefArchSharedLibrary

# export inventory lists
b2c job export --inventory-list my-inventory

# export price books
b2c job export --price-book usd-sale-prices

# combine multiple top-level categories
b2c job export --site RefArch --site-data content --catalog storefront-catalog --global-data meta_data

# full control via raw JSON data units configuration
b2c job export --data-units '{"global_data":{"meta_data":true},"sites":{"RefArch":{"content":true}}}'

# save to a specific output directory
b2c job export --global-data meta_data -o ./my-export

# save as a zip file without extracting
b2c job export --global-data meta_data --zip-only

# leave the archive on the instance without downloading
b2c job export --global-data meta_data --no-download

# keep the archive on the instance after downloading
b2c job export --global-data meta_data --keep-archive

# set a timeout (seconds)
b2c job export --global-data meta_data --timeout 600
```

#### Output Directory Semantics

When `--output` names a directory, the CLI extracts the downloaded platform zip as-is. Platform exports contain a generated top-level directory such as `<timestamp>_export`, so `--output migrations` creates `migrations/<generated>_export/...`; it does not merge data units directly into `migrations/`. If `--output` ends in `.zip`, the CLI writes that exact zip path instead.

For an ordered import-set migration, export to the import-set directory, rename the one newly generated archive root once to its permanent ordered name, and then review and trim it in place:

```bash
b2c job export --site RefArch --site-data site_descriptor --output migrations
mv migrations/<GENERATED_EXPORT_DIR> migrations/20260815T120000-update-site-descriptor
b2c job import-set --dry-run
```

Do not require a temporary directory and copy step for export-based migrations. Never export over an existing or applied archive. See `b2c-cli:b2c-import-set-migrations` for naming, trimming, retry, and deployment rules, and `b2c-cli:b2c-site-import-export` for valid archive structure.

#### Available Data Units

**Top-level categories** (each takes one or more IDs via flags):

| Flag               | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--site`           | Site IDs to export (use `--site-data` to pick specific units, defaults to all) |
| `--catalog`        | Catalog IDs                                                                    |
| `--library`        | Library IDs                                                                    |
| `--inventory-list` | Inventory list IDs                                                             |
| `--price-book`     | Price book IDs                                                                 |
| `--global-data`    | Global data units (comma-separated names from the list below)                  |

**Site data units** (use with `--site-data`):

`ab_tests`, `active_data_feeds`, `all`, `cache_settings`, `campaigns_and_promotions`, `content`, `coupons`, `custom_objects`, `customer_cdn_settings`, `customer_groups`, `distributed_commerce_extensions`, `dynamic_file_resources`, `gift_certificates`, `ocapi_settings`, `payment_methods`, `payment_processors`, `redirect_urls`, `search_settings`, `shipping`, `site_descriptor`, `site_preferences`, `sitemap_settings`, `slots`, `sorting_rules`, `source_codes`, `static_dynamic_alias_mappings`, `stores`, `tax`, `url_rules`

**Global data units** (use with `--global-data`):

`access_roles`, `all`, `csc_settings`, `csrf_whitelists`, `custom_preference_groups`, `custom_quota_settings`, `custom_types`, `geolocations`, `global_custom_objects`, `job_schedules`, `job_schedules_deprecated`, `locales`, `meta_data`, `oauth_providers`, `ocapi_settings`, `page_meta_tags`, `preferences`, `price_adjustment_limits`, `services`, `sorting_rules`, `static_resources`, `system_type_definitions`, `users`, `webdav_client_permissions`

For full control over the export configuration (including `catalog_static_resources`, `library_static_resources`, and `customer_lists`), use `--data-units` with a JSON string matching the `ExportDataUnitsConfiguration` shape.

### View Job Logs

```bash
# get the log from the most recent execution of a job
b2c job log my-custom-job

# get the log from the most recent failed execution
b2c job log my-custom-job --failed

# get the log from a specific execution
b2c job log my-custom-job abc123-def456
```

### Search Job Executions

```bash
# search for recent job executions
b2c job search

# filter by job ID
b2c job search --job-id my-custom-job

# filter by status
b2c job search --status ERROR
b2c job search --status RUNNING,PENDING

# control result count and pagination
b2c job search --count 50 --start 0

# sort results
b2c job search --sort-by start_time --sort-order desc

# search with JSON output
b2c job search --json
```

### Wait for Job Completion

```bash
# wait for a specific job execution to complete (requires both job ID and execution ID)
b2c job wait <job-id> <execution-id>

# wait with a timeout
b2c job wait <job-id> <execution-id> --timeout 600

# wait with a custom polling interval
b2c job wait <job-id> <execution-id> --poll-interval 5
```

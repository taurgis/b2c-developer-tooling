# Authentication Setup

This guide covers setting up authentication for the B2C CLI, including Account Manager API clients, OCAPI permissions, and WebDAV access.

## Overview

The CLI uses different authentication mechanisms depending on the operation:

| Operation                                                                                          | Auth Method                  | Setup Required                                                                           |

| [SLAS](/cli/slas) client management                                                                | OAuth                        | None (uses built-in client) or [API Client](#account-manager-api-client)                 |
| [Sandbox](/cli/sandbox) management                                                                 | OAuth                        | None (uses built-in client) or [API Client](#account-manager-api-client)                 |

| [MRT](/cli/mrt) commands                                                                           | MRT API Key                  | [MRT API Key](#managed-runtime-api-key)                                                  |

::: tip Zero-Config for Platform Commands
Sandbox, SLAS, and Account Manager commands work out of the box without any client configuration. The CLI includes a built-in public client that authenticates via browser login (Authorization Code + PKCE). You only need to configure an API client if you want to use client credentials for automation/CI or need specific scopes.
:::

::: tip
Each CLI command page documents its specific authentication requirements. See the [CLI Reference](/cli/) for details.
:::

## Account Manager API Client

Most CLI operations require an Account Manager API Client. This is configured in the Salesforce Commerce Cloud Account Manager.

### Authentication Methods

The CLI supports five authentication methods:

| Method                             | When Used                                                                                      | Role Configuration                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **User Authentication**            | When `--user-auth` is passed, or when only a client ID is provided (no secret)                 | Roles configured on your **user account** |
| **Client Credentials**             | When both `--client-id` and `--client-secret` are provided                                     | Roles configured on the **API client**    |
| **JWT Bearer**                     | When `--jwt-cert` and `--jwt-key` are provided (certificate-based authentication)              | Roles configured on the **API client**    |
| **Stateful User Authentication**   | After running `b2c auth login` — browser-based login, token stored and reused                  | Roles configured on your **user account** |
| **Stateful Client Authentication** | After running `b2c auth client` — client credentials login, token stored and reused            | Roles configured on the **API client**    |

**User Authentication** opens a browser for interactive login and uses roles assigned to your user account. This is ideal for development and manual operations. Use `--user-auth` as a shorthand for `--auth-methods user` on any OAuth command — both select the Authorization Code + PKCE flow.

In dw.json, the same shorthand is available as `"user-auth": true`. It is mutually exclusive with `"auth-methods"` — set one or the other, not both.

**Client Credentials** uses the API client's secret for non-interactive authentication. This is ideal for CI/CD pipelines and automation.

**JWT Bearer** uses a public/private certificate pair for authentication without storing client secrets. See [JWT Authentication](#jwt-authentication-certificate-based) for details.

**Stateful User Auth** uses `b2c auth login` to open a browser for interactive login once (Authorization Code + PKCE). The CLI persists both the access token *and* a long-lived refresh token, so subsequent commands silently refresh expired access tokens without re-opening the browser. Clear the session with `b2c auth logout`. See [Auth Commands](/cli/auth#b2c-auth-login) for details.

**Stateful Client Auth** uses `b2c auth client` to authenticate once with client credentials (or user/password) and store the **access token** for reuse across subsequent commands. The client secret is never persisted, and there is no automatic refresh — when the access token expires, re-run `b2c auth client` with the same credentials. For refresh-capable user authentication, use `b2c auth login` instead. See [Auth Commands](/cli/auth#b2c-auth-client) for details.

After signing in with `auth login` or `auth client`, you can omit the client ID from later commands. The CLI automatically reuses the valid saved session when no other client is configured.

::: warning Stateful vs Stateless Precedence
The stored session is used only when the token is valid **and** no explicit auth flags are provided. The CLI falls back to stateless auth when:
- The stored token is **expired or invalid** — a warning suggests re-running `b2c auth client --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>` (for client-credentials sessions) or `b2c auth login` (for user sessions).
- **Explicit stateless auth flags** are passed (`--client-secret`, `--user-auth`, or `--auth-methods`) — a warning lists the flags that triggered the override. Remove them to use the stored session. Note that `--client-id` alone does not force stateless; the stored session is used if the configured client ID matches.

To opt out of stateful auth entirely, run `b2c auth logout` to clear the stored session. The CLI will then use stateless auth exclusively.
:::

::: tip
For Account Manager operations that require user-level roles (organization and API client management), use `--user-auth` to authenticate with your user account. See [Account Manager Authentication](/cli/account-manager#authentication) for per-subtopic role requirements.
:::

### Creating an API Client

1. Log in to [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com).
2. Navigate to **API Client** in the left menu.
3. Click **Add API Client**.
4. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Display Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "B2C CLI")
   - **Password**: A strong client secret (save this securely for Client Credentials auth)
5. Configure the **Token Endpoint Auth Method**:
   - `client_secret_basic` for client credentials flow
   - `private_key_jwt` for JWT Bearer authentication (certificate-based)

::: info
For client credentials with secrets, use `client_secret_basic` (the default). `client_secret_post` is not currently supported.
:::

### Assigning Roles

Roles grant permission to perform specific operations. Roles are configured differently depending on your authentication method.

#### Understanding Roles and Tenant Filters

Most roles require a **tenant filter** that specifies which tenants/realms the role applies to. This is configured alongside the role assignment.

| Role                              | Operations                                | Notes                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Salesforce Commerce API`         | SCAPI commands and CIP analytics commands | API clients only. Requires a tenant filter.   |
| `Sandbox API User`                | ODS management, SLAS client management    | Requires tenant filter with realm/org IDs.  |
| `SLAS Organization Administrator` | SLAS client management (user auth only)   | User accounts only. Requires a tenant filter. |

#### For Client Credentials (Roles on API Client)

Under the API Client's **Roles** section:

1. Add roles needed for your operations
2. For each role, configure the **tenant filter** with the tenant IDs (for example, `zzxy_prd`) or realm IDs you need to access

**Important:** The `Salesforce Commerce API` role is currently only available for API Clients, not user accounts.

#### For User Authentication (roles on User)

In Account Manager, navigate to your user account and add roles. Note that some operations require Client Credentials authentication.

### Configuring Scopes

Under **Default Scopes**, add the following scopes based on your needs:

| Scope          | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mail`         | Required for user info in authentication flows            |
| `roles`        | Critical - returns role information in the token          |
| `tenantFilter` | Critical - returns tenant access information in the token |
| `openid`       | Required for OpenID Connect                               |

For SCAPI commands, also add the relevant API scopes:

| Scope                | Commands              | Reference                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `sfcc.cdn-zones`     | eCDN read operations  | [eCDN Commands](/cli/ecdn)          |
| `sfcc.cdn-zones.rw`  | eCDN write operations | [eCDN Commands](/cli/ecdn)          |
| `sfcc.scapi-schemas` | SCAPI schema browsing | [SCAPI Schemas](/cli/scapi-schemas) |
| `sfcc.custom-apis`   | Custom API status     | [Custom APIs](/cli/custom-apis)     |

**Note:** Do NOT add `SALESFORCE_COMMERCE_API` as a scope. This is a role, not a scope.

See the individual CLI command pages for complete scope requirements.

### Configuring Tenant Filter

For ODS, SLAS, and SCAPI operations, your API client's roles must have a tenant filter configured:

1. In Account Manager, go to the API Client settings
2. Under each role (for example, `Salesforce Commerce API`, `Sandbox API User`), find the **Tenant Filter**
3. Add the tenant IDs (for example, `zzxy_prd`) or organization IDs you need to access

The tenant filter restricts which tenants/realms the role applies to.

### Redirect URLs

For **User Authentication** (Authorization Code + PKCE), configure redirect URLs in your API client:

| Redirect URL                                                         | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http://localhost:8080`                                              | Required for B2C CLI user authentication                  |
| `https://admin.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com/oauth2-redirect.html` | Optional - enables ODS Swagger interface with same client |

**Note:** Redirect URLs are not required for API clients using only Client Credentials or JWT Bearer authentication.

**Use a public client.** The Authorization Code + PKCE flow requires the API client to be registered in Account Manager as a **public client** (not a confidential client). Public clients have no secret and selecting that type configures the Authorization Code + PKCE grant automatically. A client's type can't be changed after creation, so a legacy implicit-only client must be replaced by a newly-created public client, not converted. See [Implicit Flow Deprecation (PKCE Migration)](#implicit-flow-deprecation) for the transitional fallback behavior and how to resolve the deprecation warning.

::: tip Running Behind a Proxy
If you're running the CLI behind a proxy where `localhost:8080` isn't reachable by the browser, set `SFCC_REDIRECT_URI` to the proxy URL (e.g., `https://proxy.example.com:8080`). The proxy should forward traffic to the CLI's local server. You can also change the local server port with `SFCC_OAUTH_LOCAL_PORT`. Make sure to add your proxy URL to the API client's redirect URLs in Account Manager.

## JWT Authentication (Certificate-Based)

JWT Bearer authentication (RFC 7523) is an alternative to client secrets that uses public/private certificate pairs. This can be useful in environments where you want to avoid storing client secrets.

### How It Works

1. You generate a certificate pair (public certificate + private key)
2. You register the **public certificate** in Account Manager
3. The CLI uses the **private key** to sign JWT tokens for authentication
4. Account Manager verifies the signature using your registered certificate

### Benefits

- **No client secret required**: Authenticate without storing a client secret
- **Rotation**: Certificates can be rotated without updating secrets across pipelines
- **Industry standard**: Implements OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer (RFC 7523)

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Generate Certificate Pair

Generate an RSA certificate pair using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout key.pem \
  -out cert.pem \
  -days 365 \
  -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=B2C CLI"
```

This creates two files:
- `cert.pem` - Public certificate (upload to Account Manager)
- `key.pem` - Private key (keep secure on your machine)

::: tip Encrypted Keys
For additional security, generate an encrypted private key by omitting `-nodes` and adding a passphrase when prompted. You'll provide the passphrase via `--jwt-passphrase` when using the CLI.
:::

#### Step 2: Register Certificate in Account Manager

1. Log in to [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com)
2. Navigate to **API Client** and select your client
3. Set **Token Endpoint Auth Method** to `private_key_jwt`
4. Upload `cert.pem` in the **Certificates** section
5. Save changes

::: tip Multiple Certificates per Client
You can register **multiple certificates** for the same API client. This is useful for:
- **Team collaboration**: Each developer generates their own key pair and registers their certificate
- **Key rotation**: Add a new certificate before removing the old one (zero downtime)
- **Multi-environment**: Different certificates for CI/CD, staging, production

Account Manager will verify JWT signatures against all registered certificates, so each team member can authenticate with their own private key while sharing the same client ID.
:::

#### Step 3: Configure CLI

You can provide JWT credentials via CLI flags, environment variables, or configuration files.

**Using CLI flags:**

```bash
b2c code list \
  --client-id your-client-id \
  --jwt-cert ./cert.pem \
  --jwt-key ./key.pem
```

**Using environment variables:**

```bash
export SFCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export SFCC_JWT_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem
export SFCC_JWT_KEY=/path/to/key.pem

b2c code list
```

**Using dw.json:**

```json
{
  "hostname": "your-instance.demandware.net",
  "client-id": "your-client-id",
  "jwt-cert-path": "./cert.pem",
  "jwt-key-path": "./key.pem"
}
```

**For encrypted keys:**

```bash
b2c code list \
  --client-id your-client-id \
  --jwt-cert ./cert.pem \
  --jwt-key ./key.pem \
  --jwt-passphrase "your-passphrase"

# Or via environment variable
export SFCC_JWT_PASSPHRASE=your-passphrase
```

### Authentication Priority

JWT authentication is tried **after** client credentials (if client secret is available) but **before** the user (browser) flow:

1. `client-credentials` - Uses client secret if available
2. `jwt` - Uses JWT certificate if configured (no client secret)
3. `user` - Opens browser for Authorization Code + PKCE login

The legacy `implicit` flow has been removed from the default chain. It is still selectable via `--auth-methods implicit` for backwards compatibility, but emits a deprecation warning; OAuth 2.1 deprecates implicit for public clients.

To force JWT authentication even when a client secret is configured:

```bash
b2c code list --auth-methods jwt
```

### Troubleshooting

**"JWT certificate file not found"**
- Verify the certificate path is correct
- Use absolute paths or paths relative to current directory

**"Invalid JWT private key"**
- Check that the key file is in PEM format
- If encrypted, ensure you provide the correct passphrase via `--jwt-passphrase`

**"JWT authentication failed (401)"**
- Verify the certificate is registered in Account Manager
- Ensure the Token Endpoint Auth Method is set to `private_key_jwt`
- Check that the client ID matches the API client with the registered certificate

**"Invalid certificate format"**
- The certificate must be in PEM format (starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`)
- Regenerate the certificate using the OpenSSL command above

### Security Best Practices

- **Keep private keys secure**: Never commit `key.pem` to version control
- **Add to .gitignore**: Include `*.pem` and `*.key` in your `.gitignore`
- **Use encrypted keys in production**: Generate keys with passphrases for production use
- **Rotate certificates regularly**: Generate new certificates periodically (every 90-365 days)
- **Store passphrases securely**: Use secret managers for passphrases in CI/CD

## OCAPI Configuration

For operations that interact with B2C Commerce instances (code deployment, jobs, sites), you need to configure OCAPI permissions on each instance.

### Configuring OCAPI in Business Manager

1. Log in to Business Manager
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Site Development** > **Open Commerce API Settings**
3. Select the **Data API** type
4. Add a configuration for your client ID

### Example OCAPI Configuration

```json
{
  "_v": "24.5",
  "clients": [
    {
      "client_id": "your-client-id",
      "resources": [
        {
          "resource_id": "/code_versions",
          "methods": ["get"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id": "/code_versions/*",
          "methods": ["get", "put", "patch", "delete"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id": "/jobs/*/executions",
          "methods": ["post"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id": "/jobs/*/executions/*",
          "methods": ["get"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id": "/job_execution_search",
          "methods": ["post"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id": "/sites",
          "methods": ["get"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id": "/sites/*",
          "methods": ["get"],
          "read_attributes": "(**)",
          "write_attributes": "(**)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Minimal Configuration by Feature

**Code management only:**

```json
{
  "resource_id": "/code_versions",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/code_versions/*",
  "methods": ["get", "put", "patch", "delete"]
}
```

**Job execution only:**

```json
{
  "resource_id": "/jobs/*/executions",
  "methods": ["post"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/jobs/*/executions/*",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/job_execution_search",
  "methods": ["post"]
}
```

**Site listing only:**

```json
{
  "resource_id": "/sites",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/sites/*",
  "methods": ["get"]
}
```

**BM administration (`bm roles`, `bm users`, `bm whoami`, `bm access-key`):**

```json
{
  "resource_id": "/roles",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/roles/*",
  "methods": ["get", "put", "delete"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/roles/*/users",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/roles/*/users/*",
  "methods": ["put", "delete"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/roles/*/permissions",
  "methods": ["get", "put"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/users",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/users/*",
  "methods": ["get", "patch", "delete"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/users/this",
  "methods": ["get"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/users/*/access_key/*",
  "methods": ["get", "put", "patch", "delete"]
},
{
  "resource_id": "/user_search",
  "methods": ["post"]
}
```

::: tip BM functional permissions
`bm whoami` and the `bm access-key` family additionally require *a real BM user identity*. Service-client tokens cannot resolve to a BM user, so the CLI defaults these commands to browser-based user auth. Access-key writes also require the **Manage_Users_Access_Keys** BM functional permission on the user account performing the request — grant it via **Administration** > **Roles & Permissions** in Business Manager. See [BM Commands → Authentication](/cli/bm#authentication) for details.

## SCAPI Authentication

SCAPI commands (eCDN, SCAPI schemas, custom APIs) require OAuth authentication with specific roles and scopes.

### Required Setup

1. **Role:** Assign the `Salesforce Commerce API` role to your API client with appropriate tenant filter
2. **Scopes:** Add required SCAPI scopes to your API client's Default Scopes

### Scopes by Command

| Command                       | Required Scope       | Reference                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `b2c scapi schemas list/get`  | `sfcc.scapi-schemas` | [SCAPI Schemas](/cli/scapi-schemas) |
| `b2c scapi custom status`     | `sfcc.custom-apis`   | [Custom APIs](/cli/custom-apis)     |
| `b2c ecdn` (read operations)  | `sfcc.cdn-zones`     | [eCDN](/cli/ecdn)                   |
| `b2c ecdn` (write operations) | `sfcc.cdn-zones.rw`  | [eCDN](/cli/ecdn)                   |

The CLI automatically requests these scopes. Your API client must have them in the Default Scopes list.

::: tip
For detailed authentication requirements including specific scopes for each command, see the individual [CLI command reference pages](/cli/).
:::

### Configuration

```bash
# Set credentials
export SFCC_CLIENT_ID=my-client
export SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=my-secret
export SFCC_TENANT_ID=zzxy_prd
export SFCC_SHORTCODE=kv7kzm78

# Example: List SCAPI schemas
b2c scapi schemas list

## WebDAV Access

WebDAV is required for file upload operations (`code deploy`, `code watch`, `webdav` commands). There are two ways to authenticate, depending on who (or what) is connecting:

- **Basic Authentication** — for individual developers using their own Business Manager account during interactive, local development.
- **OAuth** — for API clients and automation (CI/CD pipelines, scripts) where no human is logging in.

### Option A: Basic Authentication (user access)

Use your Business Manager username and a WebDAV access key. This is the simplest option for interactive, user-based access during local development.

1. In Business Manager, go to **Administration** > **Organization** > **Users**
2. Select your user
3. Generate or view your **WebDAV Access Key**

See [Configure WebDAV File Access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=cc.b2c_account_manager_sso_use_webdav_file_access.htm&type=5) for detailed instructions.

```bash
export SFCC_USERNAME=your-bm-username
export SFCC_PASSWORD=your-webdav-access-key
```

### Option B: OAuth-based WebDAV (API client access)

For API clients and automation (CI/CD), use OAuth credentials instead of a user's basic auth. This requires configuring WebDAV Client Permissions for the API client:

1. Log in to Business Manager
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Organization** > **WebDAV Client Permissions**
3. Add a JSON configuration for your API client ID:

```json
{
  "clients": [
    {
      "client_id": "your-client-id",
      "permissions": [
        {"path": "/cartridges", "operations": ["read_write"]},
        {"path": "/impex", "operations": ["read_write"]},
        {"path": "/logs", "operations": ["read_write"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Common paths for CLI operations:

| Path                      | Operations             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `/cartridges`             | Code deployment        |
| `/impex`                  | Site import/export     |
| `/logs`                   | Log file access        |
| `/catalogs/<catalog-id>`  | Catalog file access    |
| `/libraries/<library-id>` | Content library access |

**Note:** This configuration is only needed when using OAuth for WebDAV. It isn’t required when using basic authentication with username/access key.

## Managed Runtime API Key

MRT commands use a separate API key system.

### Getting an MRT API Key

1. Log in to the [Managed Runtime dashboard](https://runtime.commercecloud.com/)
2. Navigate to **Account Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy and save the key securely (it's only shown once)

### Configuring the API Key

```bash
# Save credentials to ~/.mobify
b2c mrt save-credentials --user your-email@example.com --api-key your-mrt-api-key

# Or use an environment variable
export MRT_API_KEY=your-mrt-api-key
```

## Quick Start Example

Here's a complete example for setting up CLI access:

### 1. Create API Client in Account Manager

1. Log in to [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com)
2. Navigate to **API Client** > **Add API Client**
3. Configure:
   - **Display Name**: `B2C CLI`
   - **Password**: Generate a strong secret (save securely)
   - **Roles**:
     - `Salesforce Commerce API` - add tenant filter with your tenant IDs
     - `Sandbox API User` - if using ODS (add tenant filter)
   - **Default Scopes**: `mail roles tenantFilter openid sfcc.cdn-zones`
   - **Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost:8080` (for user authentication)

### 2. Configure OCAPI (for code list/activate/delete, jobs, sites)

Add the JSON configuration shown in [OCAPI Configuration](#ocapi-configuration) to enable code version and job APIs.

### 3. Configure WebDAV Access (for code deploy/watch, webdav commands)

Either:

- Use your BM username + WebDAV access key (for user-based, interactive development), or
- Configure WebDAV Client Permissions for OAuth (for API clients and CI/CD)

### 4. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# OAuth credentials
export SFCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# Instance (for OCAPI commands)
export SFCC_SERVER=your-instance.demandware.net

# SCAPI (for eCDN, schemas, custom-apis)
export SFCC_TENANT_ID=zzxy_prd
export SFCC_SHORTCODE=kv7kzm78

# WebDAV (if using BM credentials)
export SFCC_USERNAME=your-bm-username
export SFCC_PASSWORD=your-webdav-access-key
```

### 5. Test the Configuration

```bash
# Test OAuth + OCAPI
b2c code list

# Test WebDAV
b2c webdav ls --root=cartridges

# Test SCAPI
b2c scapi schemas list
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" errors

- Verify your client ID and secret are correct
- Check that OCAPI is configured for your client ID
- Ensure the API client has the required roles

### "Forbidden" on WebDAV operations

- Check WebDAV Client Permissions in Business Manager
- Verify your WebDAV access key is correct
- Ensure the folder you're accessing is permitted

### "Invalid scope" errors

- Add the required scopes to your API client's Default Scopes
- For SCAPI commands, ensure the relevant `sfcc.*` scopes are in Default Scopes
- Verify that Default Scopes includes `mail roles tenantFilter openid`

## Implicit Flow Deprecation (PKCE Migration) {#implicit-flow-deprecation}

The browser-based `user` authentication method now uses the **Authorization Code flow with PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange). The legacy **implicit** flow is deprecated for public clients per OAuth 2.1 and is no longer the default. Most users are unaffected — this section is for those with a legacy implicit-only client seeing a deprecation warning.

### What changed

- `b2c auth login` and the `user` auth method use Authorization Code + PKCE by default and persist a **refresh token**, so subsequent commands refresh silently without re-opening the browser.
- The implicit flow is still selectable for backward compatibility via `--auth-methods implicit` (or `"auth-methods": ["implicit"]` in `dw.json`), but it emits a deprecation warning and cannot obtain refresh tokens.

### You must use a public client

PKCE requires the Account Manager client to be a **public client**. Selecting that type in Account Manager configures the Authorization Code + PKCE grant automatically and the client has no secret.

**An Account Manager client's type cannot be changed after it is created.** A legacy implicit-only client therefore has to be **replaced by a newly-created public client** — it cannot be converted in place. Create a new public client, add the CLI's redirect URI (`http://localhost:8080` by default), and use its client ID.

### Transitional automatic fallback

To keep existing users working during the migration, if the configured client is **not** a PKCE-capable public client, the `user` flow automatically falls back to the deprecated implicit flow for that client and logs a warning:

```
[Auth] Authorization Code + PKCE failed for client <id> (<oauth error>). Falling back to
the deprecated implicit flow. Recommend creating a new public (PKCE) client in Account
Manager and using it to remove this warning.
```

The fallback triggers **only** for OAuth errors that indicate the client is not a public/PKCE client — `invalid_client` (Account Manager requires client authentication at the token exchange; the most common case for legacy implicit clients), `unauthorized_client`, `unsupported_response_type`, and `unsupported_grant_type`. Other failures (for example `invalid_scope` from requesting scopes the client can't have, or a cancelled login) surface directly without falling back, because they would fail identically under the implicit flow.

To resolve the warning, create a new public client as described above and use its client ID. To disable the fallback entirely and surface PKCE failures directly, set `SFCC_DISABLE_PKCE_FALLBACK=1`. The fallback is temporary and will be removed once public clients have migrated.

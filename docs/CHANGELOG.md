# @salesforce/b2c-dx-docs

## 0.3.22

### Patch Changes

- [#631](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/631) [`b0b24b8`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/b0b24b8fae8c57186b94a7dab3a27dfcf85f49f1) - Made MCP project resolution provenance consistent and tool guidance more concise, kept local paths out of tool descriptions, and clarified startup documentation workspace detection. Updated MCP protocol libraries and made tool input schemas reject unknown arguments. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.21

### Patch Changes

- [#629](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/629) [`1f25b1e`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/1f25b1ed3bf5c778b30ec2de8dff1e26071db5d1) - Added per-call named-instance selection and consistent resolution provenance to project-aware MCP tools, including persisted context for debugger sessions and log watches. Removed the retired Storefront Next MCP toolset in favor of the current Storefront Next agent skills. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.20

### Patch Changes

- [#627](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/627) [`5f7bff4`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/5f7bff40b53c54ba3f0d9d245bab7c4d5f94c227) - Add a shared global `dw.json` for the CLI, MCP server, and VS Code extension, managed with `b2c setup default-config set|get|unset`; primary and global instances are available together without merging their fields. MCP tools now accept per-call `projectDirectory` and `configPath`; debugger callers must rename `cartridge_directory` to `cartridgeDirectory` and remove `client_id`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.19

### Patch Changes

- [`a90f173`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/a90f1730e6ccd366e50a35d8ee91a320fc5301ec) - Make unified configuration inspection recognize all CLI configuration environment variables and aliases, and show resolved authentication, project, service, and safety settings only when configured. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [`a90f173`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/a90f1730e6ccd366e50a35d8ee91a320fc5301ec) - Allow projects to configure a non-sensitive default `siteId` under the package.json `b2c` key for site-aware commands. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.18

### Patch Changes

- [#615](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/615) [`1f553b3`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/1f553b3e26c57909ce654b61e25f4db537111312) - Added ordered, idempotent site archive import sets with verified WebDAV receipts, retry-until-receipted behavior, and serialized concurrent runners. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#615](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/615) [`1f553b3`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/1f553b3e26c57909ce654b61e25f4db537111312) - Added the data migrations plugin to the third-party plugins guide so users can discover idempotent, version-controlled IMPEX and scripted deployments. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#624](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/624) [`02ccc2a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/02ccc2a1656c4895c2aca7ef2064fd2ff138e9a2) - Import discovered cartridge metadata before migration-directory items, supporting single-archive and ordered-child layouts, an opt-out, and project-configurable recursive source exclusions. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#618](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/618) [`abec39f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/abec39fbc4843b00c426c6fc2ac26492e67df11d) - Update the embedded B2C Commerce Script API TypeScript definitions from version 26.7 to 26.9 so IDE IntelliSense reflects the latest platform APIs. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.17

### Patch Changes

- [#603](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/603) [`94c7ba9`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/94c7ba979716e8401234f48178f488a4e5b29ac3) - Add Codex plugin packaging for the B2C DX MCP server so Codex CLI and Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app can install and load the MCP server directly through the B2C Developer Tooling plugin marketplace. Claude Code marketplace installation remains supported by the same plugin. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.16

### Patch Changes

- [#592](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/592) [`f6b4ced`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f6b4ced5d40b8fcd8a9fbaf524f6dcdd83852b02) - Detect nested `dw.json` project roots in VS Code workspaces and allow nested folders to be pinned from Explorer, so parent-folder and multi-root layouts connect to the intended project. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#590](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/590) [`3fb0871`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/3fb08711a90f3dc216fce5b8418b6fef0a6dfca9) - Document the figma-to-sfnext-pagedesigner plugin in the Agent Skills guide (Thanks [@lukejohnson-sf](https://github.com/lukejohnson-sf)!)

- [#592](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/592) [`f6b4ced`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f6b4ced5d40b8fcd8a9fbaf524f6dcdd83852b02) - Treat activation of an already-active code version as success, preserve useful OCAPI fault details, and avoid redundant activation choices in VS Code. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.15

### Patch Changes

- [#581](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/581) [`1fe5ff2`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/1fe5ff2e49b4aef66c81ad9b9c9dd4b92d1da405) - Expose directly related documentation IDs from Salesforce Help child-topic links and Developer Center guide TOCs, including articles previously omitted from composite Help maps or hyphenated topic filenames. CLI and MCP documentation search results can now be paged by ranked position, so agents can traverse the full published content without surfacing future-profiled Help content. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#587](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/587) [`afeccee`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/afecceed7c6e6ac2ab6e5eff1d2f6f8e59692f5b) - Update the VS Code extension docs for its Marketplace and Open VSX launch: lead with installing directly from the editor's Extensions view (search for "Salesforce B2C Commerce"), document Open VSX availability for Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, and other VS Code–compatible editors, and clarify that this is the official Salesforce B2C Commerce extension. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.14

### Patch Changes

- [#579](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/579) [`17d8eba`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/17d8eba792ab02bd708a13b7ef6996cee22b2bed) - Prepare the VS Code extension for its 1.0 Marketplace launch with a public-facing README, feature tour, setup guidance, Marketplace installation instructions, and support links. Contributor build, test, and packaging instructions now live in `DEVELOPMENT.md`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.13

### Patch Changes

- [`4b3ecd1`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/4b3ecd15d66112725adca54007a743ac540a8cb1) - Clarify that commands without a configured client ID reuse the saved stateful session. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.12

### Patch Changes

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add page-specific SEO meta descriptions to the SCAPI Schemas CLI reference and CI/CD guide pages, replacing the site-wide default description. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add XSD-based validation, autocomplete, and hover docs for B2C metadata XML files, backed by ~50 bundled schemas (catalogs, promotions, jobs, services, A/B tests, page-meta-tags, sorting rules, source codes, content libraries, event routing, and more). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  **Namespace-based association.** Validation is matched by the document's declared XML namespace, not by filename or folder layout, so a metadata file validates against the correct schema wherever it lives — in a canonical site-archive (`sites/<id>/…`), an exploded `metadata/` workspace, or anywhere else. The extension ships an XML catalog and registers it with the Red Hat XML language server at runtime; no changes are written to your `settings.json`.

  **Optional companion extension.** Validation is powered by the Red Hat XML extension (`redhat.vscode-xml`), a _soft_ dependency — it is not force-installed and no Java runtime is required. When you open a B2C metadata XML file, the extension offers to install it (with a "Don't ask again" option); until then the extension is unaffected. You can trigger setup any time via the **B2C DX: Set Up Metadata XML Validation** command, and disable the whole feature with the `b2c-dx.features.xmlValidation` setting. Teams whose policies block third-party extensions can simply decline the prompt.

## 0.3.11

### Patch Changes

- [`db905f4`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/db905f431e89518031aa7ce1fe47be90cbdd5f2d) - Fix stale MCP docs sidebar label ("Script API & Schemas" → "Documentation Tools") to match the renamed multi-corpus documentation reference page. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.10

### Patch Changes

- [#545](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/545) [`ed1e214`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/ed1e21405f69503e693c7bcadb8b9cc1f4a09ddf) - Stop MCP debug tools from routinely suggesting the session cookie (`dwsid`). The cookie is only needed in the rare multi-app-server production instance group case where a breakpoint is never hit — it is now surfaced as a troubleshooting hint on breakpoint timeout instead of in the `debug_start_session`/`debug_list_sessions` descriptions. Also clarifies that the debugger needs standard Basic auth (account password or a `WebDAV File Access and UX Studio` access key) with no separate Business Manager enablement step. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#553](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/553) [`31ec679`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/31ec679ca6058d2ba7f453528af873163a5baeff) - Reworked the MCP Server documentation to be leaner and human-focused: trimmed internal implementation prose from the tool reference pages, reorganized the nav around toolsets and logical tool groups (combined the two log pages and the two SCAPI custom-API pages, with client-side redirects from the old URLs), corrected the project-type auto-detection table, and removed agent-directed prompting guidance. Renamed the homepage/header "Agent Skills" entry to "Agent Plugins" and grouped the MCP plugin with the core plugins in the install instructions. The `b2c-docs` skill now notes that the MCP `docs_*` tools offer the same coverage as the CLI. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  The `tooling` documentation corpus (the CLI/MCP/SDK guides available via `docs search`/`read`) no longer bundles a copy of each page's markdown in the SDK — like the Developer Center guides, its content is now fetched online from the docs site at read time (with an offline fallback to the indexed summary). This shrinks the package and stops doc edits from duplicating content into the SDK.

## 0.3.9

### Patch Changes

- [#533](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/533) [`f3d2d9e`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f3d2d9ec98fed2b61e47622a9f2ef58ae13ee735) - GitHub Actions: the high-level actions (`code-deploy`, `data-import`, `job-run`, `webdav-upload`) and the root action now forward the full set of auth/config inputs to `setup` — `account-manager-host`, `short-code`, `tenant-id`, `certificate`, `certificate-passphrase`, `selfsigned`, and `webdav-server` (where applicable). Previously these were silently dropped with an "Unexpected input(s)" warning, so a non-default Account Manager host or staging mTLS credentials had to be set via env vars or a separate `setup` step. Also bumped the bundled `setup-node`/`checkout` references to Node 24-capable majors to clear the Node 20 deprecation warning. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#532](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/532) [`76643fa`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/76643fa370ac598ba005dcce69ee2004c43eee79) - Fix the `setup` GitHub Action silently corrupting any credential that contains a `$` (for example an auto-generated WebDAV access key like `abc$FOO123`). The action wrote credentials to the job environment with an inline-interpolated `echo`, so bash re-expanded `$WORD` sequences and stripped them — the altered credential then failed downstream WebDAV auth with an unexplained 401. Credentials are now passed through the step's `env` block and written with GitHub's heredoc env syntax, so values containing `$`, quotes, backticks, `$(...)`, `=`, or even newlines reach the CLI byte-for-byte. No workflow changes are required; re-run with the fixed action version. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#530](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/530) [`6cfb9bd`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/6cfb9bd4b2a45ad838df86371f85e31c425caf88) - Document the standard (system) job steps that B2C Commerce ships for Business Manager job flows. The bundled docs corpus now includes the full catalog of standard job step type IDs (e.g. `ImportCatalog`, `ExportCatalog`, `ExecutePreconfiguredDataReplicationProcess`, `SearchReindex`) with each step's purpose, scope, and configuration parameters — sourced from the public B2C Commerce Job Step API documentation and searchable through `b2c docs search`/`b2c docs read` (and the `docs_search`/`docs_read` MCP tools) with no new commands. Read the catalog with `b2c docs read job-steps` or a specific step with `b2c docs read <TypeID>`. The job and custom-job-step skills now cover referencing an IMPEX-staged file from a prior step, chaining custom and standard steps in one flow, and choosing an in-flow system step vs. the CLI equivalent (e.g. a standard catalog import vs. `b2c job import`). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#526](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/526) [`fb9fbf9`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/fb9fbf9ae20c078c00ca144b25c341e02677da3d) - Trim the Script Debugger guide to remove implementation detail (internal API name, `client_id`, transport plumbing, roadmap note) and a duplicated interface list, keeping it focused on what users need to debug. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [`b6d2879`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/b6d287992b9a0bd85e1bc80ac2920d1af282ccb5) - Clarify WebDAV authentication guidance: Basic Auth is for interactive user-based access while OAuth is for API clients and CI/CD, rather than labeling Basic Auth as generally "recommended". (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- [#518](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/518) [`7a55915`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/7a5591524e8374413cc92303b907e164f1b172f3) - Refocus the Commerce Apps (CAP) documentation on the B2C CLI workflow and recommend the `b2c-cli`, `b2c`, and `cap-dev` agent skills plugins (the latter from the `SalesforceCommerceCloud/commerce-apps` marketplace). The guide now links to the official Commerce Apps ISV Developer Guide as the authoritative spec rather than duplicating it, and corrects several details against canon and the CLI source: the tax extension point is `sfcc.app.tax.calculate`, the install upload path is `Impex/commerce-apps/`, the lifecycle states are `INSTALLING → INSTALLED → NOT_CONFIGURED → CONFIGURING → CONFIGURED`, and `cap package` produces `{id}-v{version}.zip`. The `b2c-cap` skill and CAP CLI reference gain WebDAV auth, icon-naming, and registry-vs-local-validation clarifications. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- [#498](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/498) [`c58924d`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/c58924d643dc80251ff0cf35dbf8a647fb16d662) - Deprecate the Storefront Next MCP tools (`sfnext_*`) in favor of the `storefront-next` and `storefront-next-figma` agent-skills plugins. These tools are not compatible with the Storefront Next 1.0 GA release and will be removed in a future release. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  The six `sfnext_*` tools have moved to a new `STOREFRONTNEXT_DEPRECATED` toolset that is never auto-enabled by project detection and is excluded from `--toolsets all`. To keep using them, request the toolset explicitly: `--toolsets STOREFRONTNEXT_DEPRECATED --allow-non-ga-tools`. Storefront Next projects still auto-enable the `STOREFRONTNEXT` toolset (MRT bundle push, SCAPI discovery/scaffolding, and diagnostics). Migrate to the agent-skills plugins — see the Agent Skills guide for installation.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- [#492](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/492) [`5af7cae`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/5af7caeb66c78196fad647b51dbdb184b8bee844) - Removed pilot note for Storefront Next (Thanks [@knhage](https://github.com/knhage)!)

- [`19f059e`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/19f059e7ba928d1070d7960920770f1256dfae73) - Document the new `storefront-next-figma` plugin in the Agent Skills guide, the install snippets (homepage, setup), and the Figma tools setup page. The plugin requires the [Figma MCP server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server) and can be installed from the plugin marketplace or with `b2c setup skills storefront-next-figma`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- [`39dc19d`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/39dc19d5c91ea537b18fd57ef8373250b74a3b83) - Document the `storefront-next` and `b2c-dx-mcp` plugins in the homepage and Agent Skills install snippets, and note that `b2c-dx-mcp` installs the MCP server. Removed the agent-facing "When to use which tool" sections from the MCP log and docs tool reference pages. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [#473](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/473) [`b723939`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/b72393951bb95b64f3291cd3cb76197e280a6a37) - Documentation audit and repair pass: corrected stale CLI flag and command references across the CLI reference and guides, fixed broken examples (e.g. eCDN mTLS, sandbox `--no-*` flags, WebDAV `get` arguments), aligned SDK JSDoc with current signatures, and added the missing `operations/cap` typedoc entry point so the Commerce App SDK module appears in the API reference. Filled in JSDoc for previously undocumented public exports across the SDK (auth, clients, instance, logging, ods, mrt, cap, cip, debug, scaffold, schemas, skills, etc.) so the generated API docs cover the full public surface. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#478](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/478) [`d19802f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/d19802f26b5e1c0a609a2a27daa60dd1763b6786) - Document the GitHub Actions install behavior change. The high-level actions (`code-deploy`, `data-import`, `job-run`, `mrt-deploy`, `webdav-upload`) now reuse an already-installed CLI and install one only when none is present — so a deploy that follows a setup step, and repeated operations on a persistent self-hosted runner, no longer trigger a redundant reinstall or an unexpected upgrade. The `setup` action called directly still installs the version you request (a new `skip-if-present` input opts into reuse). The actions no longer cache the npm download directory, which had grown to gigabytes on long-lived self-hosted runners and slowed restores. Plugin installs are skipped by exact name match. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#431](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/431) [`80d594f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/80d594f741b6eb9c8ac76a4bb954403518497478) - Document deploying to staging environments (two-factor mTLS) from CI/CD. The `setup` GitHub Action now accepts `webdav-server`, `certificate`, `certificate-passphrase`, and `selfsigned` inputs so workflows can target staging instances that require a separate WebDAV hostname and a client certificate. The CI/CD guide includes a full GitHub Actions example using a base64-encoded `.p12` secret. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`b8dcf74`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/b8dcf741c253fee0df4219400bfa10a79c704e98) - Document Cursor as a first-class skills target, including its compatibility with Claude Code and Codex skill paths so plugins installed via `claude plugin install` are auto-picked-up by Cursor. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`a670cc7`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/a670cc7c00e1ba5ee0057de7c1152bb57396c6fc) - Add page-specific SEO meta descriptions to the SCAPI Schemas CLI reference and CI/CD guide pages, replacing the site-wide default description. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#409](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/409) [`ec31234`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/ec312342e14080fb5d51b72243e763030c429f80) - Document the B2C DX VS Code Extension. New `/vscode-extension/` section with overview, installation (with a dynamic download link to the latest VSIX release), configuration reference, and a feature tour covering Sandbox Realm Explorer, Cartridge Code Sync, WebDAV Browser, Content Libraries, SCAPI API Browser, B2C Script Debugger, scaffold/CAP install, log tailing, and B2C CLI plugin support. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#408](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/408) [`a26226c`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/a26226c8d755bc3d93462418cb94ddc0f1083a29) - Replaced the BM Roles docs page with a comprehensive Business Manager reference covering all `b2c bm` commands — `bm roles` (list/get/create/delete/grant/revoke + permissions), `bm users` (list/get/search/update/delete), `bm whoami`, and `bm access-key` (get/create/set/delete). The new page documents the user-auth requirement on whoami and access-key endpoints, the access-key scope enum, and common workflows like rotating your own WebDAV password. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

### Patch Changes

- [#395](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/395) [`b947888`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/b947888ed07073ae2c4c79fe9cc00bd893b81bbe) - Add debug command documentation and b2c-debug agent skill covering interactive REPL, RPC mode, and DAP usage.

  - Documented `b2c sandbox ips`, `b2c mrt env var push`, and `b2c debug` (previously omitted).
  - Fixed `mrt project get/update/delete` examples to use the required positional slug; corrected `mrt project member add/update --role` to integer values; replaced `mrt env invalidate --path` with the actual `--pattern` flag; corrected `mrt env redirect create/delete/clone` flag names; rewrote `mrt user api-key` and `mrt user email-prefs` against the real flags.
  - Rewrote `ecdn zones create`, `ecdn cache purge`, `ecdn security update`, `ecdn speed update`, and `ecdn logpush jobs create` flag tables to match source.
  - Removed phantom flags (`--display-name`, etc.) from `am users update`.
  - Standardized Node.js requirement on `>=22.16.0` across all installation guides.
  - `account-manager` guide no longer recommends the unsupported `client_secret_post`; the `authentication` warning was reframed as guidance toward `client_secret_basic`.
  - Added a Copilot section to the agent-skills guide so the homepage Copilot link points at meaningful content.
  - Filled gaps in the CLI command-topic index (`bm-roles`, `setup`, `ecdn`, `replications`, `scapi-schemas`, `cap`, `logs`).

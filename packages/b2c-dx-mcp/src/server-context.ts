/**
 * Server-scoped persistent state that lives for the lifetime of the MCP
 * server process. Holds registries for stateful resources (debug sessions,
 * log watches) that need to span multiple tool invocations.
 *
 * ## Multi-agent / shared-state caveats
 *
 * One `ServerContext` is created per MCP server process. With the default
 * stdio transport, each MCP client connection spawns its own server
 * subprocess, so this state is naturally isolated per client/agent.
 *
 * If this server is ever wired up to a shared transport (e.g. HTTP with
 * multiple connected clients), `ServerContext` state would be shared
 * across all connected clients. Sub-agents that run within the same MCP
 * client would also share the same context. Tools that mutate registries
 * (like the debug tools) should not assume single-tenant access.
 *
 * The registries dedup on an internal stable key (host plus MCP-owned debugger client ID, hostname for
 * SFCC log watches, project/environment/origin for MRT log watches), so
 * multi-agent use is functional but agents may see each other's
 * sessions/watches via list tools.

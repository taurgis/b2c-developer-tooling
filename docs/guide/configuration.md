# Configuration

The B2C CLI, B2C DX MCP server, and Salesforce B2C Commerce VS Code extension share the same configuration model. In this guide, **the tooling** refers to these surfaces collectively. The tooling automatically discovers available credentials and project settings from environment variables and configuration files, while each surface also supports its own explicit overrides.

## CLI Flags

### OAuth (SCAPI/OCAPI)

OAuth is required for API operations (code list/activate/delete, jobs, sites, SCAPI commands, SLAS, ODS) and can also be used for WebDAV file operations when basic auth credentials are not provided.

#### Client Credentials

OAuth client credentials uses a client ID and secret for non-interactive authentication:

```bash
b2c code deploy \
  --server abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
  --client-id your-client-id \
  --client-secret your-client-secret
```

#### JWT Bearer

JWT Bearer uses certificate-based authentication for enhanced security without storing client secrets:

```bash
b2c code deploy \
  --server abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
  --client-id your-client-id \
  --jwt-cert ./cert.pem \
  --jwt-key ./key.pem
```

See [JWT Authentication](./authentication#jwt-authentication-certificate-based) for setup instructions.

#### User Authentication (Browser)

For development without a client secret, use the browser-based user flow (Authorization Code + PKCE):

```bash
b2c code deploy \
  --server abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
  --client-id your-client-id \
  --user-auth
```

`--user-auth` is shorthand for `--auth-methods user`. The legacy implicit flow is still selectable via `--auth-methods implicit` but emits a deprecation warning.

### Basic Authentication (WebDAV)

Basic authentication uses your B2C instance username and access key. This method is only used for WebDAV operations (code deployment, file uploads, log access).

```bash
b2c code deploy \
  --server abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com \
  --username your-username \
  --password your-access-key
```

See [Configure WebDAV File Access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=cc.b2c_account_manager_sso_use_webdav_file_access.htm&type=5) for instructions on setting up your access key.

## .env File

The tooling automatically loads a `.env` file from the selected project directory if present. Use the same `SFCC_*` variable names as environment variables.

```bash
# .env
SFCC_SERVER=abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com
SFCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

::: warning
Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing credentials.
:::

## Configuration File

You can create a `dw.json` file to store instance settings. By default, the tooling uses `dw.json` in the selected project directory.

::: tip Flexible Field Names
Both camelCase and kebab-case are accepted for all field names in `dw.json`. For example, `client-id` and `clientId` are equivalent, as are `code-version` and `codeVersion`. Legacy aliases like `server` (for `hostname`) and `passphrase` (for `certificatePassphrase`) are also still supported.
:::

### Configuration File Selection

The tooling selects a primary configuration path in this order, then adds the global `dw.json` to the available instances:

1. `--config` (or an MCP tool's `configPath`)
2. `SFCC_CONFIG` from the process environment
3. `SFCC_CONFIG` from the selected project's `.env`
4. `dw.json` in the selected project directory
5. The [global default configuration](#global-default-configuration)

A relative `SFCC_CONFIG` in a project `.env` is resolved from that project directory.

### Global Default Configuration

If you use one `dw.json` across projects, set it once as the global `dw.json`:

```bash
b2c setup default-config set /Users/you/code/dw.json
b2c setup default-config get
```

The tooling adds its instances after those from the primary file. A project's own `dw.json` therefore continues to take priority when both files contain the same instance name.

The primary and global `dw.json` files form one instance catalog. `--instance` / `-i` looks in the primary file first and then the global file; a same-name primary instance shadows the global one. Each instance remains a complete configuration entry—fields are never merged between files.

Without `-i`, the primary file's active instance or default entry wins. The global file's active instance or default entry is used only when the primary file does not provide one. Instance-management commands use the same catalog: list shows both files, create writes to the primary file when present (otherwise the global `dw.json`), and remove or set-active finds the primary instance before the global one.

For a root-level configuration, omitting `active` makes it the file's implicit default. Setting the root to `"active": false` explicitly opts it out of default selection; if no child instance in that file is active, selection continues to the global `dw.json`. Run `b2c setup inspect` to see both catalog files and which one supplied the selected instance.

To remove the global `dw.json` setting:

```bash
b2c setup default-config unset
```

The setting is shared in the B2C user configuration directory (`~/.config/b2c/settings.json` on macOS and Linux; the platform configuration directory on Windows). Use the commands above instead of editing that file directly.

If the configuration file is stored beside `settings.json`, the setting can use a relative path such as `"./dw.json"`; relative paths are resolved from the settings directory. The `set` command writes this relative form automatically for files kept there.

### Single Instance

```json
{
  "hostname": "abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com",
  "code-version": "version1",
  "client-id": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "client-secret": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-access-key"
}
```

Or with JWT Bearer authentication:

```json
{
  "hostname": "abcd-123.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com",
  "code-version": "version1",
  "client-id": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "jwt-cert-path": "./cert.pem",
  "jwt-key-path": "./key.pem"
}
```

### Multiple Instances

For projects that work with multiple instances, use the `configs` array:

```json
{
  "configs": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "active": true,
      "hostname": "abcd-001.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com",
      "code-version": "version1",
      "client-id": "dev-client-id",
      "username": "dev-username",
      "password": "dev-access-key"
    },
    {
      "name": "staging",
      "hostname": "abcd-002.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com",
      "code-version": "version1",
      "client-id": "staging-client-id",
      "username": "staging-username",
      "password": "staging-access-key"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each instance can have its own `safety` configuration for per-instance operational safety. See [Safety Mode](/guide/safety#per-instance-configuration) for details.

Use the `-i` or `--instance` flag to select a specific configuration:

```bash
b2c code deploy -i staging
```

If no instance is specified, the config with `"active": true` is used.

### Managing Instances with the CLI

Instead of editing `dw.json` by hand, you can use `b2c setup instance` commands to create, list, remove, and switch between instance configurations.

#### Quick Setup

```bash
# Interactive — prompts for hostname, auth, and code version
b2c setup instance create staging

# Non-interactive
b2c setup instance create staging \
  --hostname staging.example.com \
  --client-id my-client-id \
  --client-secret my-secret \
  --force
```

The interactive mode auto-detects the active code version via OCAPI when OAuth credentials are provided, and the first instance you create is automatically set as active.

#### Switching Instances

```bash
# Set a different instance as the default
b2c setup instance set-active production

# Or pick interactively (shows a searchable list)
b2c setup instance set-active

# Commands now use the active instance by default
b2c code list                  # Uses production
b2c code list -i staging       # Override for one command
```

#### Listing and Removing

```bash
# See all configured instances
b2c setup instance list

# Remove an instance
b2c setup instance remove staging
```

### Two-Factor Authentication (mTLS)

For instances that require client certificate authentication:

```json
{
  "hostname": "cert.staging.example.demandware.net",
  "code-version": "version1",
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-access-key",
  "certificate": "/path/to/client-cert.p12",
  "certificate-passphrase": "cert-password",
  "self-signed": true
}
```

The certificate must be in PKCS12 format (`.p12` or `.pfx`). The `self-signed` option is often needed for staging environments with internal certificates.

The same fields are available as CLI flags (`--webdav-server`, `--certificate`, `--passphrase`, `--selfsigned`) and as environment variables (`SFCC_WEBDAV_SERVER`, `SFCC_CERTIFICATE`, `SFCC_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE`, `SFCC_SELFSIGNED`).

::: tip Running staging deploys in CI/CD
For GitHub Actions workflows that target staging — including how to handle the `.p12` certificate as a base64-encoded secret — see [Staging Environments (Two-Factor mTLS)](/guide/ci-cd#staging-environments-two-factor-mtls).
:::

::: tip MRT Configuration
MRT API key can also be loaded from `~/.mobify`. See [MRT API Key](#mrt-api-key) below.
:::

For multi-instance configurations, each config object also supports:

| Field    | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | Instance name for selection with `-i`/`--instance` |
| `active` | Set to `true` to use this config by default        |

## Project Configuration (package.json)

You can store project-level defaults in your `package.json` file under the `b2c` key. This is useful for settings that are shared across your entire project and safe to commit to version control.

```json
{
  "name": "my-storefront",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "b2c": {
    "shortCode": "abc123",
    "clientId": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "siteId": "RefArch",
    "contentLibrary": "RefArch",
    "libraries": [{"id": "RefArch", "siteLibrary": true}],
    "importSetExclude": ["fixtures", "test/integration"],
    "mrtProject": "my-project",
    "accountManagerHost": "account.demandware.com"
  }
}
```

### Allowed Fields

Only non-sensitive, project-level fields can be configured in `package.json`. Both camelCase and kebab-case are accepted (e.g., `shortCode` or `short-code`):

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                        |

| `contentLibrary`     | Default content library ID for `content export` and `content list` commands                                                        |

| `mrtProject`         | MRT project slug                                                                                                                   |
| `mrtOrigin`          | MRT API origin URL override                                                                                                        |

::: warning Security Note
Sensitive fields like `hostname`, `password`, `clientSecret`, `username`, and `mrtApiKey` are intentionally **not** supported in `package.json`. These should be configured via `dw.json` (which should be in `.gitignore`), environment variables, or secure credential stores.
:::

::: tip Lowest Priority
`package.json` has the lowest priority of all configuration sources. Values from `dw.json`, environment variables, or explicit surface overrides such as CLI flags will always override `package.json` settings. This makes it ideal for project defaults that can be overridden per-environment.
:::

### Content Libraries Example

The `libraries` field can list the content libraries your project works with so that the VS Code Content Libraries tree auto-loads them and `b2c content list/export` can default `--site-library` based on the entry.

A bare string is treated as a shared library; an object can mark a library as site-private. Both forms can appear in the same array:

```json
{
  "b2c": {
    "libraries": ["RefArchSharedLibrary", {"id": "SiteGenesis", "siteLibrary": true}]
  }
}
```

With this config:

- `b2c content list --library SiteGenesis` calls the site-library API automatically (no need to pass `--site-library`); the library ID is the site ID.
- `b2c content list --library RefArchSharedLibrary` treats `RefArchSharedLibrary` as a shared library.
- `--site-library` / `--no-site-library` on the command line still wins over the config default.
- The VS Code Content Libraries tree shows both entries on activation, with `SiteGenesis` marked `[site]`.

### Resolution Priority

Configuration is resolved with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **Explicit overrides and environment variables** - Explicit values always take priority (includes CLI flags and the `.env` file)
2. **Plugin sources (high priority)** - Custom sources with `priority: 'before'` (or priority < 0)
3. **dw.json** - Project configuration file (priority 0)
4. **~/.mobify** - Home directory file for MRT API key (priority 0)
5. **Plugin sources (low priority)** - Custom sources with `priority: 'after'` (or priority 1-999)
6. **package.json** - Project-level defaults (priority 1000, lowest)

::: tip Extending Configuration
Plugins can add custom configuration sources like secret managers or environment-specific files. Plugins can use numeric priorities for fine-grained control over ordering. See [Extending the CLI](./extending) for details.
:::

### Credential Grouping

To prevent mixing credentials from different sources, certain fields are treated as atomic groups:

- **OAuth Client Credentials**: `clientId` and `clientSecret`
- **OAuth JWT Bearer**: `clientId`, `jwtCertPath`, `jwtKeyPath`, and `jwtPassphrase`
- **Basic Auth**: `username` and `password`

If any field in a group is set by a higher-priority source, all fields in that group from lower-priority sources are ignored. This ensures credential pairs always come from the same source.

**Example:**

- dw.json provides `clientId` only
- A plugin provides `clientSecret`
- Result: Only `clientId` is used; the plugin's `clientSecret` is ignored to prevent mismatched credentials

::: warning Hostname Mismatch Protection
When you explicitly specify a hostname that differs from the `dw.json` hostname, the tooling ignores all other values from `dw.json` and only uses your explicit overrides. This prevents accidentally using credentials from one instance with a different server.
:::

## MRT API Key

Managed Runtime (MRT) commands use an API key for authentication. The API key is resolved in this order:

1. `--api-key` flag
2. `MRT_API_KEY` environment variable (also accepts `SFCC_MRT_API_KEY`)
3. `~/.mobify` config file

The `~/.mobify` file format:

```json
{
  "api_key": "your-mrt-api-key"
}
```

When using the `--cloud-origin` flag to specify a different MRT endpoint, the CLI looks for `~/.mobify--{hostname}` instead. For example, `--cloud-origin https://custom.example.com` loads from `~/.mobify--custom.example.com`.

## Overriding Authentication Behavior

By default, the tooling automatically detects available credentials and tries authentication methods in this order: `client-credentials`, `jwt`, then `user` (Authorization Code + PKCE). You can override this behavior to control which methods are used.

::: tip Default Public Client
For platform-level commands (Sandbox, SLAS, and Account Manager), the CLI includes a built-in public client ID. If no `--client-id` is configured, these commands automatically use the built-in client with Authorization Code + PKCE, opening a browser for authentication. This means you can use these commands with zero configuration.
:::

### Available Auth Methods

- `client-credentials` - OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow (requires client ID and secret). Used for SCAPI/OCAPI and WebDAV.
- `jwt` - OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer flow (requires client ID, certificate, and private key). Used for SCAPI/OCAPI and WebDAV. More secure than client credentials.
- `user` - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE flow (requires client ID only, opens browser for login). Used for SCAPI/OCAPI and WebDAV.
- `implicit` - OAuth 2.0 implicit flow (deprecated — opt-in only). Selectable via `--auth-methods implicit` for backwards compatibility, but emits a deprecation warning. OAuth 2.1 deprecates implicit for public clients.
- `basic` - Basic authentication with username and access key. Used for WebDAV operations only.
- `api-key` - API key authentication. Used for MRT commands only.

### Specifying Auth Methods

You can specify allowed auth methods in priority order using comma-separated values or multiple flags:

```bash
# Comma-separated (preferred)
b2c code deploy --auth-methods client-credentials,user

# Multiple flags (also supported)
b2c code deploy --auth-methods client-credentials --auth-methods user

# Via environment variable
SFCC_AUTH_METHODS=client-credentials,user b2c code deploy
```

The tooling tries each method in order until one succeeds.

## Debugging Configuration

Use `b2c setup inspect` to view the resolved configuration and see which source provided each value:

```bash
# Display resolved configuration (sensitive values masked)
b2c setup inspect

# Show actual sensitive values
b2c setup inspect --unmask

# Output as JSON
b2c setup inspect --json
```

This command helps troubleshoot issues like:

- Verifying which configuration file is being used
- Checking if environment variables are being read
- Understanding credential source priority
- Identifying hostname mismatch protection triggers

See [setup inspect](/cli/setup#b2c-setup-inspect) for full documentation.

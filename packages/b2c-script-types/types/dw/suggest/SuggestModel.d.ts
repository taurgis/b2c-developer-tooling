/**
 * The Suggest model provides methods and functions
 * to access search suggestions.
 * 
 * The search suggestion feature basically covers two functional areas.
 * First is just to suggest words, based on the users input,
 * utilizing spell correction or prediction (also known as auto completion).
 * The second functional area is also often referred to as search-as-you-type,
 * where, based on the users input, specific items are
 * already looked up, before the user actually has completed typing a word
 * or even fired up the search.
 * 
 * This model combines both functional areas and provides access to both - the
 * suggested words and the items found while using the predicted words.
 * 
 * This model supports various types of items that are being suggested, like
 * products, categories, brands, content pages as well merchant provided search phrases.
 * For each type, there is a Suggestions implementation
 * available and accessible through this model: ProductSuggestions,
 * CategorySuggestions, BrandSuggestions, ContentSuggestions,
 * and CustomSuggestions.
 * 
 * For each type of suggestions, the actual suggested items (like
 * products) can by obtained, and, on the other hand, a list of terms
 * is provided which were used to lookup the found items.
 * The terms can be used to present a advanced user experience in the
 * storefront, e.g. show auto completed words, spell corrections and so on.
 * The SuggestModel script API will always create suggestions with Autocorrections
 * regardless of the value of "Search Autocorrections" search preference.

### Minor Changes

- [#615](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/615) [`1f553b3`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/1f553b3e26c57909ce654b61e25f4db537111312) - Added ordered, idempotent site archive import sets with verified WebDAV receipts, retry-until-receipted behavior, and serialized concurrent runners. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#624](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/624) [`02ccc2a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/02ccc2a1656c4895c2aca7ef2064fd2ff138e9a2) - Import discovered cartridge metadata before migration-directory items, supporting single-archive and ordered-child layouts, an opt-out, and project-configurable recursive source exclusions. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#619](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/619) [`591f886`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/591f886f29cc76484b42afe27f6b28f568f1373e) - `job import-set` now prints a consolidated post-import notes summary from a `README.md` (or `README`) file at the top of each applied item's directory — the idiomatic place to document manual, instance-specific follow-up steps for a migration. Notes are shown for items applied in the run and previewed for pending items during `--dry-run`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#611](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/611) [`62db97f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/62db97fefb40e56c12f41d54803db7315ec8c33a) - Add support for creating multiple sandbox clones from a single source in one request (1 to many cloning). (Thanks [@charithaT07](https://github.com/charithaT07)!)
  - `b2c sandbox clone create` now accepts `--target-count <1-5>` to create a batch of clones sharing the same source, TTL, profile, and notification emails. `--wait` polls every clone in the batch until each reaches a terminal state.
  - `b2c sandbox clone list` supports `--batch-id` to filter clones belonging to a specific batch.
  - `b2c sandbox clone get` and the VS Code extension's clone details view now show the batch ID and sibling clone IDs when a clone was created as part of a batch.
  - The VS Code extension's "Clone Sandbox" command prompts for the number of clones to create and reports aggregate progress across the batch.

- [#574](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/574) [`8d096d0`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/8d096d01a2f70eb979f1b6b246fd196b77f2acd0) - Add Authorization Code + PKCE support for browser-based OAuth (public clients) and make it the default for the `user` auth method, replacing the legacy `implicit` flow in the default chain. The default auth-method order is now `client-credentials`, `jwt`, `user`. The implicit flow is still selectable via `--auth-methods implicit` (or in dw.json) for backwards compatibility but emits a deprecation warning — OAuth 2.1 deprecates implicit for public clients. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  `b2c auth login` now uses Authorization Code + PKCE by default and persists a refresh token alongside the access token, so subsequent commands silently refresh without re-opening the browser. The new `--auth-methods` flag on `b2c auth login` lets you opt back into the legacy implicit flow (`--auth-methods implicit`). The POC `b2c auth pkce` command has been removed; use `b2c auth login` instead.

  dw.json gains a `"user-auth": true` shorthand for `"auth-methods": ["user"]`. It is mutually exclusive with `"auth-methods"` — setting both is rejected during config mapping.

  To smooth the migration, the `user` flow includes a transitional safety net: if the configured Account Manager client is not a PKCE-capable public client, it automatically falls back to the implicit flow for that client and logs a deprecation warning recommending you create a new public (PKCE) client and use it. (An AM client's type cannot be changed after creation, so a legacy implicit-only client must be replaced, not converted.) Set `SFCC_DISABLE_PKCE_FALLBACK=1` to disable the fallback and surface PKCE failures directly. This fallback is temporary and will be removed once public clients have migrated.

  Persisted browser-auth sessions (which now hold long-lived PKCE refresh tokens) are written `0o600` in a `0o700` directory, so they are no longer world-readable.

  The VS Code extension persists PKCE refresh tokens via OS-keychain-backed `SecretStorage` (with a sync-snapshot/async-write-through cache), keeping behavior compatible with the unified `AuthSessionBackend` used by the CLI.

- [#624](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/624) [`02ccc2a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/02ccc2a1656c4895c2aca7ef2064fd2ff138e9a2) - Show the target hostname and real local source for each import-set item, and reject empty site archive directories before upload with a clear error.

- [#613](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/613) [`c0ec3f6`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/c0ec3f6202ca8ee69676ae2361e8b276cd69385c) - `b2c setup inspect` now redacts the JWT private key passphrase (`jwtPassphrase`) by default, matching the other secret fields. Use `--unmask` to show it. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#500](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/500) [`35f2960`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/35f296036a0659d115617bb2770327cca250bad7) - Add support for Page Designer "content blocks" (reusable `fragment.*`-typed content). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Content blocks are now a first-class node type: the SDK classifies them as `FRAGMENT` (instead of mislabeling them as components), parses their display name, and exposes `Library.getContentBlocks()` to list a library's blocks (including unlinked ones). The CLI renders them distinctly in `content export`/`content list` (as `CONTENT BLOCK`), counts them in export summaries, and supports `content list --type fragment`. In the VS Code extension, each library gains a **Content Blocks** group that is the single source of truth for a block; because blocks are shared singletons, every page/component that links a block shows a reference that reveals the canonical block in the group rather than an editable copy. (Converting a component into a content block is done in Business Manager / Page Designer — it is not offered here because reproducing it via site-archive import can silently drop a Layout block's child links.)

Use `--force` to skip the prompt (e.g. in CI or scripted installs); the prompt is also skipped automatically in `--json` mode. (Thanks [@jbisaSF](https://github.com/jbisaSF)!)

When merging with the current client, the command split the API's pipe-delimited `callbackUri` value on commas instead of pipes, so the entire list was sent back as a single string and the update was rejected with "CallbackURI must be a valid URL". Callback URIs are now parsed with the same shared helper used for redirect URIs everywhere in the SLAS commands, so the two paths can no longer disagree.

Pass a path-like `--filter`/`prefixes` value containing a `/` — e.g. `--filter internal/server` to target `server-*.log` files under `internal/`, or `--filter internal/` for everything in that subdirectory. Plain prefix filters (and the default listing) are unchanged and still only scan the top-level `Logs/` directory, so there is no performance impact unless you opt in with a path filter. Works across `logs list`, `logs get`, `logs tail`, and the corresponding MCP tools. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

### Minor Changes

- [#563](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/563) [`9fb332d`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/9fb332d92cc3289d2796c97a4c70f839dfe5f999) - Script API reference content is now read online (from developer.salesforce.com) instead of shipping in the package, reducing the installed SDK/CLI size by ~6 MB. Documentation search is unchanged and still works offline from the bundled index; only `docs read` for a `dw.*` class now fetches its content. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  To keep reads fast, fetched documentation content (Script API, Developer Center guides, and Salesforce Help) is cached locally — in memory for the session and on disk (under the CLI cache dir) for 7 days — so repeated reads avoid the network. A new `b2c docs cache` command shows the cache location and size, and `b2c docs cache --clear` empties it. When a fetch fails, `docs read` falls back to the indexed summary and prints both the article URL and the raw markdown URL so you can retrieve the page yourself.

- [#563](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/563) [`9fb332d`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/9fb332d92cc3289d2796c97a4c70f839dfe5f999) - Add a Salesforce Help documentation corpus to `docs search`/`docs read` (and the MCP docs tools), covering Business Manager administration and merchandising content from help.salesforce.com. It is split into two categories — `help-admin` (import/export, jobs, replication, security, Account Manager, permissions, logs, inventory) and `help-merchant` (catalogs, products, promotions, search, content, analytics, SEO) — so you can search platform-administration and merchandising topics alongside the existing Script API, Developer Center, and tooling docs. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  You can scope the whole docs corpus to chosen categories with the new `docsCategories` config field, sourced from `dw.json` (`docs-categories`), the `SFCC_DOCS_CATEGORIES` env var, or `package.json` — in addition to the existing `--topics` / `--docs-topics` flags (which still override config). For example, set `"docs-categories": ["script-api", "job-step", "help-admin", "tooling"]` in dw.json to expose only developer + admin docs.

The SDK exposes `createPreferencesClient` and the CLI exposes a new `b2c preferences` topic with `global list/get/update`, `site list/get/update/search`, and `site preference get/update` commands. Read scope is `sfcc.preferences`; write scope is `sfcc.preferences.rw`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

The `setup ide` topic retains `vscode-types` (vendor Script API TypeScript definitions) and `tsserver-plugin` (print the TS Server plugin path for LSP editors). Users of the B2C DX VS Code extension need no setup; other editors can use `setup ide vscode-types` or `setup ide tsserver-plugin`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Exact id lookups (e.g. `dw.catalog.ProductMgr`) are unaffected — they resolve deterministically. The CLI gains a `--workspace` flag on `docs read` (defaults to auto-detect; `all` opts out); the MCP `docs_read` uses the server's detected workspace.

### Minor Changes

- [#552](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/552) [`fdf3c5f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/fdf3c5fe570ff71fddfc4aa0d83c9e3a05be5406) - Add Metrics API support (**CLOSED BETA**). The new SCAPI Observability Metrics API (`observability/metrics/v1`) is now available across the tooling: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - **SDK:** a typed `createMetricsClient` plus `getOverallMetrics`, `getSalesMetrics`, `getEcdnMetrics`, `getThirdPartyMetrics`, `getScapiMetrics`, `getScapiHooksMetrics`, `getMrtMetrics`, `getControllerMetrics`, `getOcapiMetrics`, and `getMetricsByCategory` operations that fetch operational time-series metrics for an organization. Admin OAuth scope `sfcc.metrics` is handled automatically. Time bounds accept a `Date` or epoch milliseconds and are sent to the API as epoch seconds; response timestamps are normalized to epoch milliseconds. Optional `enrichMetricsTags`/`parseSeriesTags` helpers add a structured `tags` object (`realm`, `environment`, applied filters, and per-series dimensions like `apiFamily`/`host`/`cacheStatus`) to each series, so consumers can group and filter by dimension instead of parsing the packed series id.
  - **CLI:** a new `metrics` topic with per-category commands (`b2c metrics overall`, `b2c metrics scapi`, `b2c metrics ocapi`, etc.) and `b2c metrics list` — with table and `--json` output. The time window is set with `--from`/`--to` (relative like `1h`/`7d` or ISO 8601) and an optional `--window` duration (e.g. `--from 7d --window 1h` for a one-hour window seven days ago). Any open bound defaults to a 24-hour window (the API caps a window at 24 hours), so requests always send an explicit range. Category-specific filter flags (`--api-family`, `--api-name`, `--ocapi-category`, `--ocapi-api`, `--third-party-service-id`) live only on the command they apply to. Each series is enriched with a structured `tags` object by default; use `--no-tags` for the raw API shape.
  - **MCP:** a `metrics_get` tool in the SCAPI toolset (gated as non-GA; requires `--allow-non-ga-tools`). Series are returned with the structured `tags` object.

Documentation search now spans Script API reference, standard job steps, Developer Center guides (Commerce API, PWA Kit, SFRA, Storefront Next, B2C Commerce), and this tooling's own guides, with content-aware ranking and workspace-aware results tuned to the detected project type. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  - When a command needs instance/auth configuration but no source is found at all (no flags, environment variables, or dw.json), the error now points to the configuration guide (https://salesforcecommercecloud.github.io/b2c-developer-tooling/guide/configuration.html) so first-time users know where to start. When a config source is present, the existing message (which lists the specific flag/env var to set) is unchanged.
  - Command-error telemetry now tags each error with a category (`validation`, `guardrail`, or `runtime`) so expected user/config errors and safety-guard blocks can be separated from genuine runtime failures when measuring reliability.
  - All telemetry events now include an `isCI` flag indicating whether they originated from a CI/automation environment, so automation traffic can be distinguished from interactive developer usage.

Content is always sourced from `.md`, and Script API reference entries gain durable `developer.salesforce.com` permalinks (previously only guides had URLs). Surface them in the CLI with `--columns url,sourceUrl` (or `-x`) and in the MCP `docs_search` `verbose` output. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Per RFC 6749 §2.3.1, the client ID and secret are now form-url-encoded before being Base64-encoded into the HTTP Basic `Authorization` header, matching how they are already encoded when sent in the request body. Previously a raw `+` in a secret was decoded to a space by Account Manager, causing `invalid_client` errors on Basic auth even though the same credential worked via the request body. Affects the client-credentials/password grants (`b2c auth client`, token renewal) and SLAS private-client flows. (Thanks [@j-256](https://github.com/j-256)!)

The server-side unzip step now has an explicit timeout, and if the connection drops it reports a clear error noting the server may still be extracting the archive (so it is not silently re-run, which could corrupt the code version) and leaves the uploaded archive in place for verification.

(Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Direct dependencies of the published packages were bumped in package.json so that consumers installing the SDK, CLI, or MCP server receive the patched versions: the SDK raises `js-yaml`, `minimatch`, `protobufjs`, and `undici`, and the MCP server raises `yaml` and `postcss`. The SDK also upgrades `applicationinsights` from 2.x to 3.x to pick up a non-vulnerable `@opentelemetry/core`; this is an internal telemetry change with no public API impact.

  Remaining transitive advisories with no direct-dependency lever are pinned to patched releases (within their existing major versions) via workspace overrides: fast-xml-parser, hono, @hono/node-server, ws, vite, rollup, form-data, http-proxy-middleware, path-to-regexp, serialize-javascript, lodash, underscore, flatted, fast-uri, tmp, express-rate-limit, brace-expansion, shell-quote, and @opentelemetry/core.

  `reorder`) for managing custom firewall rules on a CDN zone via the existing
  cdn-zones v1 APIs (`/firewall-custom/rules`). Supports partial updates,
  `--json` output (with table column flags on `list`), and routes destructive

With `--split` (and optional `--max-size`, default `190mb`), the import is broken into several smaller archives: order-sensitive metadata/XML is imported first — kept together when it fits, otherwise split at data-unit boundaries in dependency order — followed by static assets packed by compressed size. A normal import that exceeds the limit now warns and recommends `--split`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Example: `b2c job import ./big-site-data --split --max-size 150mb`

  The SDK adds a corresponding `siteArchiveImportSplit()` operation.

Paths are resolved literally first (so shell-expanded globs work) and fall back to root-relative or internal glob expansion when the literal path doesn't exist. The archive preserves each path's layout under `TARGET`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Example: `b2c job import ./my-site-data sites/RefArch libraries/mylib`

  The SDK's `siteArchiveImport` operation gains a corresponding `paths` option for directory targets.

This lets you mark site-private libraries in `dw.json` or `package.json` so `b2c content list` / `content export` can default `--site-library` based on which library you target, and the VS Code Content Libraries tree auto-loads every configured library on activation. To upgrade, optionally replace `"libraries": ["RefArchSharedLibrary"]` with `"libraries": ["RefArchSharedLibrary", {"id": "SiteGenesis", "siteLibrary": true}]`. The existing string-only form continues to work unchanged. Also adds `libraries`, `assetQuery`, and `realm` to the documented `package.json` allowed fields list (already supported in code).

Also added `b2c bm users access-keys` (`get`, `create`, `set`, `delete`) for provisioning and rotating WebDAV/OCAPI/SCAPI access keys for externally-managed (AM/SSO) users. The SDK now exposes a matching `@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk/operations/bm-users` module. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Roughly 30 commands that previously had no column-customization support — including `bm roles list`, `webdav ls`, `cap list`, `code list`, `content list`, `docs search`, `job search`, `logs list`, `sites list`, `slas client list`, all `mrt` list commands, plus several `setup` and `scaffold` commands — now accept `-c id,name,...` to pick columns and `-x` to include extended fields (e.g. `webdav ls --extended` exposes the previously-hidden `modified` and `contentType` columns). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  The SDK now exposes shared `columnFlagsFor()` / `selectColumns()` helpers (replacing 22 duplicated implementations) and a `printFieldsBlock()` helper for rendering "label / value" detail blocks.

  - `b2c cip query`, `cip describe`, `cip tables`, and `cip report *` now stream output through oclif's `ux.stdout` instead of writing directly to `process.stdout`. This restores the `--json` flag and makes output capturable by tests and CI.
  - Long-running commands (`code:watch`, `logs:tail`, `mrt:tail-logs`) now deregister their SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers when finished, so re-invocations no longer stack handlers on the same process.
  - Hook and signal-handler errors that were previously swallowed (`job:run` afterOperation hooks, `logs:tail` stop, `setup:ide:prophet` console fallbacks) now log at debug instead of disappearing.
  - AM list commands (`am clients|roles|users list`) share a single `amPageSizeFlag` definition.
  - Removed deprecated `LocalSourceResult` re-export.

(Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  New commands:
  - `b2c cap validate` — validates CAP structure, manifest, and cartridge rules locally
  - `b2c cap package` — packages a CAP directory into a distributable `.zip`
  - `b2c cap install` — installs a CAP on an instance via WebDAV + `sfcc-install-commerce-app` job
  - `b2c cap uninstall` — uninstalls a CAP via `sfcc-uninstall-commerce-app` job

  New SDK exports in `@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk/operations/cap`: `validateCap`, `commerceAppInstall`, `commerceAppUninstall`, `commerceAppPackage`.

  The VS Code extension gains CAP directory detection (badge decoration) and an "Install Commerce App (CAP)" context menu action.

  - `cap list` exports and parses `commerce_feature_states` to show installed features with type, source, status, and version
  - `cap tasks` displays configuration tasks for an installed app with clickable Business Manager links
  - `cap pull` downloads and extracts installed app source packages for cartridge deployment or Storefront Next development
  - Standardize all cap commands to use `--site-id` flag (with `--site` as alias)
  - `cap uninstall` no longer requires `--domain` — looks it up automatically from the feature state
  - `cap install` now keeps the archive on the instance by default (use `--clean-archive` to remove)

The existing `--update` and `--force` flags still work non-interactively. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Examples now assume values like `tenantId`, `shortCode`, and `clientId` are resolved from `dw.json` / `SFCC_*` env vars, with flags shown only as overrides. This prevents coding agents from prompting users for values that are already configured. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

(Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - Add a Codex plugin marketplace so the three plugins (`b2c-cli`, `b2c`, `b2c-dx-mcp`) can be installed directly from Codex CLI's plugin directory.
  - Add a new `b2c-onboarding` skill (in the `b2c` plugin) that walks new developers through CLI verify, `dw.json` setup, sandbox connect, and first cartridge deploy, then hands off to the topic-specific skill for the user's goal.
  - Add per-plugin READMEs with install instructions for each supported client.
  - Document Copilot CLI + VS Code Copilot install paths and the Codex marketplace install path.
  - Remove the `b2c-experimental` plugin from the public marketplace.

  Shows all configuration values organized by category (Instance, Authentication, SCAPI, MRT) and indicates which source file or environment variable provided each value. Sensitive values are masked by default; use `--unmask` to reveal them.

- [#59](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/59) [`253c1e9`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/253c1e99dbb0962e084d644c620cc2ec019f8570) Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)! - Reorganizes MRT commands by scope: project-level commands under `mrt project`, environment-level under `mrt env`, and deployment commands under `mrt bundle`. The `mrt bundle download` command now downloads files by default instead of just printing the URL.

- [#64](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/64) [`c35f3a7`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/c35f3a78c4087a8a133fe2d013c7c61b656a4a34) Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)! - Fix HTML response bodies appearing in ERROR log lines. When API requests fail with non-JSON responses (like HTML error pages), error messages now show the HTTP status code (e.g., "HTTP 521 Web Server Is Down") instead of serializing the entire response body.

  Added `getApiErrorMessage(error, response)` utility that extracts clean error messages from ODS, OCAPI, and SCAPI error patterns with HTTP status fallback.

description: Manage Commerce App Packages (CAPs), also called commerce apps or apps, and commerce features using the b2c CLI. Use this skill whenever the user needs to validate, package, install, uninstall, list, or pull commerce apps on B2C Commerce instances, view configuration tasks, or pull app sources for cartridge deployment or Storefront Next development. Also use when checking which apps are installed on an instance, inspecting app details or versions, or managing app lifecycle — even if they just say "what apps do I have", "list my commerce apps", "which CAPs are installed", "install this app", "pull app sources", or "show installed apps".

# B2C CAP Skill

Use the `b2c` CLI plugin to **validate, package, install, uninstall, list, and pull** Commerce App Packages (CAPs) and commerce features on Salesforce B2C Commerce instances.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli cap list`).

## Configuration & Authentication

The CLI auto-discovers the target instance and credentials from `SFCC_*` environment variables, `dw.json` in the current or parent directories, `~/.mobify`, `package.json`, and configuration plugins. **Flags like `--server`, `--client-id`, and `--client-secret` are usually unnecessary** — only pass them to override what's auto-detected.

Run `b2c setup inspect` to see the resolved configuration and which source provided each value (use `--json` for scripting, `--unmask` to reveal secrets). For precedence rules and troubleshooting, see the `b2c-cli:b2c-config` skill.

The remote commands (`cap install`, `cap uninstall`, `cap tasks`, `cap pull`, and `cap list` without `--local`) require **both** OCAPI access (for running the system job) and **WebDAV** access (for uploading/downloading archives). WebDAV authenticates via `SFCC_USERNAME`/`SFCC_PASSWORD` (BM username + WebDAV access key), `--user-auth` for interactive browser login, or an Account Manager OAuth client granted WebDAV permissions on the `/impex` path; SCAPI is not a substitute for the WebDAV upload. The local-only commands (`cap validate`, `cap package`, and `cap list --local`) need no credentials.

> **Authoring vs. operating:** This skill covers **operating** on existing CAPs against an instance (validate, package, install, uninstall, list, tasks, pull). To **author** a new CAP — scaffold the structure, generate IMPEX, run registry-grade validation, or submit to the registry — install the `cap-dev` skills with `b2c setup skills cap-dev`, or via the commerce-apps marketplace: `claude plugin marketplace add SalesforceCommerceCloud/commerce-apps` then `claude plugin install cap-dev`.

## Examples

### List Installed Features

```bash
# list all commerce features across all sites
b2c cap list

# list features for specific sites
b2c cap list --site-id RefArch,SiteGenesis

# list with full JSON output (includes config tasks and installation metadata)
b2c cap list --json

# list locally detected CAP directories
b2c cap list --local
```

### Pull App Sources

Pull installed Commerce App source packages for cartridge deployment or Storefront Next (`sfnext`) development. Pulled apps are extracted into `./commerce-apps/{name}/`. Depending on the app's architecture, a package may contain `cartridges/` and `impex/` data (backend or fullstack apps) and/or `storefront-next/` extensions (UI-only or fullstack apps) ready for use with the `sfnext` CLI.

```bash
# pull all registry apps to ./commerce-apps
b2c cap pull

# pull a specific app by name
b2c cap pull avalara-tax

# pull to a custom output directory
b2c cap pull --output ./my-apps

# pull apps installed on a specific site
b2c cap pull --site-id RefArch
```

### View Configuration Tasks

```bash
# show configuration tasks with clickable BM links
b2c cap tasks avalara-tax --site-id RefArch

# get tasks as JSON
b2c cap tasks avalara-tax --site-id RefArch --json
```

### Validate a CAP

```bash
# validate a local CAP directory
b2c cap validate ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5

# validate a CAP zip file (cap package produces {id}-v{version}.zip)
b2c cap validate ./avalara-tax-v0.2.5.zip

# validate with JSON output
b2c cap validate ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --json
```

### Package a CAP

```bash
# package a CAP directory into a distributable zip
b2c cap package ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5

# package with a custom output path
b2c cap package ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --output ./dist/my-app.zip
```

> Every cartridge under `cartridges/site_cartridges/` and `cartridges/bm_cartridges/` must have a `.project` file. `cap package` auto-creates an empty one for any cartridge missing it (existing `.project` files, empty or full Eclipse XML, are left untouched); `cap validate` fails if any cartridge is still missing one.

### Install a CAP

```bash
# install a CAP directory on an instance
b2c cap install ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --site-id RefArch

# install a pre-packaged zip
b2c cap install ./avalara-tax-v0.2.5.zip --site-id RefArch

# install with a timeout
b2c cap install ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --site-id RefArch --timeout 600

# skip validation before install
b2c cap install ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --site-id RefArch --skip-validate

# remove the uploaded archive after install
b2c cap install ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --site-id RefArch --clean-archive

# create a Storefront Next pull request for the app's storefront content
# (requires a repository connected to the storefront; off by default)
b2c cap install ./commerce-avalara-tax-app-v0.2.5 --site-id RefArch --create-pr
```

### Uninstall a CAP

```bash
# uninstall a commerce app (domain is looked up automatically)
b2c cap uninstall avalara-tax --site-id RefArch
```

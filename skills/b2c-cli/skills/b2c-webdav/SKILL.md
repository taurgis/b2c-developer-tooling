description: List, upload, download, and manage files on B2C Commerce instances via WebDAV. Use this skill whenever the user needs to upload files to IMPEX directories, download exports from an instance, list remote files, create or delete directories, zip or unzip files on the server, manage file transfers to sandboxes, or browse instance file systems — even if they just say "upload a file to the instance" or "check what's in the IMPEX folder".

# B2C WebDAV Skill

Use the `b2c` CLI plugin to perform WebDAV file operations on Salesforce B2C Commerce instances. This includes listing files, uploading, downloading, and managing files across different WebDAV roots.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli webdav ls`).

## Configuration & Authentication

The CLI auto-discovers the target instance and credentials from `SFCC_*` environment variables, `dw.json` in the current or parent directories, `~/.mobify`, `package.json`, and configuration plugins. **Flags like `--server`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`, `--username`, and `--password` are usually unnecessary** — only pass them to override what's auto-detected.

Run `b2c setup inspect` to see the resolved configuration and which source provided each value (use `--json` for scripting, `--unmask` to reveal secrets). For precedence rules and troubleshooting, see the `b2c-cli:b2c-config` skill.

## WebDAV Roots

The `--root` flag specifies the WebDAV directory:

- `impex` (default) - Import/Export directory
- `temp` - Temporary files
- `cartridges` - Code cartridges
- `realmdata` - Realm data
- `catalogs` - Product catalogs
- `libraries` - Content libraries
- `static` - Static resources
- `logs` - Application logs
- `securitylogs` - Security logs

## Examples

### List Files

```bash
# list files in the default IMPEX root
b2c webdav ls

# list files in a specific path
b2c webdav ls src/instance

# list files in the cartridges root
b2c webdav ls --root=cartridges

# list files with JSON output
b2c webdav ls --root=impex --json
```

### Download Files

```bash
# download a file from IMPEX (default root)
b2c webdav get src/instance/export.zip

# download to a specific local path
b2c webdav get src/instance/export.zip -o ./downloads/export.zip

# download from a specific root
b2c webdav get customerror.log --root=logs

# output file content to stdout
b2c webdav get src/instance/data.xml -o -
```

### Upload Files

```bash
# upload a file to IMPEX
b2c webdav put ./local-file.zip src/instance/

# upload to a specific root
b2c webdav put ./my-cartridge.zip --root=cartridges
```

### Create Directories

```bash
# create a directory in IMPEX
b2c webdav mkdir src/instance/my-folder

# create a directory in a specific root
b2c webdav mkdir my-folder --root=temp
```

### Delete Files

```bash
# delete a file
b2c webdav rm src/instance/old-export.zip

# delete from a specific root
b2c webdav rm old-file.txt --root=temp
```

### Delete Cartridges

To delete cartridges from a code version, use the `cartridges` root with the path format `{code-version}/{cartridge-name}`:

```bash
# delete a cartridge from a code version
b2c webdav rm v25_1_0/app_mysite --root=cartridges

# delete multiple cartridges
b2c webdav rm v25_1_0/app_mysite --root=cartridges
b2c webdav rm v25_1_0/int_myintegration --root=cartridges

# list cartridges in a code version first
b2c webdav ls v25_1_0 --root=cartridges
```

**Important:** The path is `{code-version}/{cartridge-name}`, not `/cartridges/{code-version}/...`. The `--root=cartridges` (or `-r cartridges`) flag sets the WebDAV root.

### Zip/Unzip Remote Files

```bash
# create a zip archive of a remote directory
b2c webdav zip src/instance/my-folder

# extract a remote zip archive
b2c webdav unzip src/instance/archive.zip
```

### Import-Set Managed State

Do not manually script marker files when the goal is to apply a local set of site import/export archives once. Use the higher-level command:

```bash
b2c job import-set
```

To start over without deleting the previous history, use a new set ID and keep using it on subsequent runs:

```bash
b2c job import-set --set-id migrations-reset-20260818
```

To reset the default history in place, remove it and rerun the import set:

```bash
b2c webdav rm --root=impex b2c-cli/import-sets/migrations
b2c job import-set
```

For a custom set ID, replace the final `migrations` path segment with that ID. Resetting in place permanently forgets which archives succeeded and makes every current archive pending again, so only use it when every archive is safe to reapply. `--break-lock` is for recovery and does not reset history.

For the canonical workflow, naming convention, retry behavior, and recovery rules, use the `b2c-cli:b2c-site-import-export` skill's **Apply an Ordered, Idempotent Import Set** section.

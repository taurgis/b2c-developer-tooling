### Patch Changes

- [#627](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/627) [`5f7bff4`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/5f7bff40b53c54ba3f0d9d245bab7c4d5f94c227) - Add a shared global `dw.json` for the CLI, MCP server, and VS Code extension, managed with `b2c setup default-config set|get|unset`; primary and global instances are available together without merging their fields. MCP tools now accept per-call `projectDirectory` and `configPath`; debugger callers must rename `cartridge_directory` to `cartridgeDirectory` and remove `client_id`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

### Minor Changes

- [#500](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/500) [`35f2960`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/35f296036a0659d115617bb2770327cca250bad7) - Add support for Page Designer "content blocks" (reusable `fragment.*`-typed content). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Content blocks are now a first-class node type: the SDK classifies them as `FRAGMENT` (instead of mislabeling them as components), parses their display name, and exposes `Library.getContentBlocks()` to list a library's blocks (including unlinked ones). The CLI renders them distinctly in `content export`/`content list` (as `CONTENT BLOCK`), counts them in export summaries, and supports `content list --type fragment`. In the VS Code extension, each library gains a **Content Blocks** group that is the single source of truth for a block; because blocks are shared singletons, every page/component that links a block shows a reference that reveals the canonical block in the group rather than an editable copy. (Converting a component into a content block is done in Business Manager / Page Designer — it is not offered here because reproducing it via site-archive import can silently drop a Layout block's child links.)

- [#611](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/611) [`62db97f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/62db97fefb40e56c12f41d54803db7315ec8c33a) - Add support for creating multiple sandbox clones from a single source in one request (1 to many cloning). (Thanks [@charithaT07](https://github.com/charithaT07)!)
  - `b2c sandbox clone create` now accepts `--target-count <1-5>` to create a batch of clones sharing the same source, TTL, profile, and notification emails. `--wait` polls every clone in the batch until each reaches a terminal state.
  - `b2c sandbox clone list` supports `--batch-id` to filter clones belonging to a specific batch.
  - `b2c sandbox clone get` and the VS Code extension's clone details view now show the batch ID and sibling clone IDs when a clone was created as part of a batch.
  - The VS Code extension's "Clone Sandbox" command prompts for the number of clones to create and reports aggregate progress across the batch.

- [#617](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/617) [`bee72c2`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/bee72c26e3427f177bee6a28374821164eb9cdbb) - Start, stop, and restart the active sandbox from the Command Palette (Realm Explorer context menus still target the selected sandbox) (Thanks [@clstopher](https://github.com/clstopher)!)

### Patch Changes

- [#574](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/574) [`8d096d0`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/8d096d01a2f70eb979f1b6b246fd196b77f2acd0) - Add Authorization Code + PKCE support for browser-based OAuth (public clients) and make it the default for the `user` auth method, replacing the legacy `implicit` flow in the default chain. The default auth-method order is now `client-credentials`, `jwt`, `user`. The implicit flow is still selectable via `--auth-methods implicit` (or in dw.json) for backwards compatibility but emits a deprecation warning — OAuth 2.1 deprecates implicit for public clients. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  `b2c auth login` now uses Authorization Code + PKCE by default and persists a refresh token alongside the access token, so subsequent commands silently refresh without re-opening the browser. The new `--auth-methods` flag on `b2c auth login` lets you opt back into the legacy implicit flow (`--auth-methods implicit`). The POC `b2c auth pkce` command has been removed; use `b2c auth login` instead.

  dw.json gains a `"user-auth": true` shorthand for `"auth-methods": ["user"]`. It is mutually exclusive with `"auth-methods"` — setting both is rejected during config mapping.

  To smooth the migration, the `user` flow includes a transitional safety net: if the configured Account Manager client is not a PKCE-capable public client, it automatically falls back to the implicit flow for that client and logs a deprecation warning recommending you create a new public (PKCE) client and use it. (An AM client's type cannot be changed after creation, so a legacy implicit-only client must be replaced, not converted.) Set `SFCC_DISABLE_PKCE_FALLBACK=1` to disable the fallback and surface PKCE failures directly. This fallback is temporary and will be removed once public clients have migrated.

  Persisted browser-auth sessions (which now hold long-lived PKCE refresh tokens) are written `0o600` in a `0o700` directory, so they are no longer world-readable.

  The VS Code extension persists PKCE refresh tokens via OS-keychain-backed `SecretStorage` (with a sync-snapshot/async-write-through cache), keeping behavior compatible with the unified `AuthSessionBackend` used by the CLI.

- [#614](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/614) [`9382697`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/9382697c2715d16577fa298465a3d2dbcbef0ca9) - Fix sandbox creation in the VS Code extension not granting default OCAPI/WebDAV permissions. New sandboxes created from the extension now grant the configured client ID the same default permissions as the CLI's `sandbox create`, so code deployment and job execution work without manual permission setup. The shared defaults are now provided by the SDK via `buildSandboxSettings`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#618](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/618) [`abec39f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/abec39fbc4843b00c426c6fc2ac26492e67df11d) - Update the embedded B2C Commerce Script API TypeScript definitions from version 26.7 to 26.9 so IDE IntelliSense reflects the latest platform APIs. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#621](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/621) [`fc8d762`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/fc8d76238c4f39fe61287217fff833e846590881) - Honor the `SFCC_CONFIG` environment variable when resolving instance configuration. Previously the extension only looked for a `dw.json` in the workspace folder and ignored a global `dw.json` referenced by `SFCC_CONFIG`, so projects that relied on that env var (e.g. alongside a project `.env`) resolved to "No B2C Commerce instance configured". The extension now threads `SFCC_CONFIG` through as the explicit config path, matching the CLI's `--config` flag. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- Updated dependencies [[`02ccc2a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/02ccc2a1656c4895c2aca7ef2064fd2ff138e9a2), [`1f553b3`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/1f553b3e26c57909ce654b61e25f4db537111312), [`02ccc2a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/02ccc2a1656c4895c2aca7ef2064fd2ff138e9a2), [`35f2960`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/35f296036a0659d115617bb2770327cca250bad7), [`d5551f3`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/d5551f351836f12d2c167459441093671bcad9bc), [`02ccc2a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/02ccc2a1656c4895c2aca7ef2064fd2ff138e9a2), [`591f886`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/591f886f29cc76484b42afe27f6b28f568f1373e), [`c0ec3f6`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/c0ec3f6202ca8ee69676ae2361e8b276cd69385c), [`62db97f`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/62db97fefb40e56c12f41d54803db7315ec8c33a), [`8d096d0`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/8d096d01a2f70eb979f1b6b246fd196b77f2acd0), [`9382697`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/9382697c2715d16577fa298465a3d2dbcbef0ca9), [`2de9046`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/2de904636dad1b1f23a80da8b640dc8acd6e97f3)]:

### Patch Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/598) [`258f6bd`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/258f6bdfc9f698fcebefca192d6ce7dd54bb4f0e) - Stop the VS Code extension from blocking other extensions in empty or non-B2C windows. Because the extension registers a TypeScript server plugin, VS Code activates it whenever any JavaScript/TypeScript file is opened — including windows with no folder. In that case the extension no longer falls back to the process working directory, and all cartridge/workspace discovery now runs only from a concrete workspace folder and never from a home or filesystem-root directory, so it can't trigger a recursive filesystem scan that stalls the extension host. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [#592](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/592) [`f6b4ced`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f6b4ced5d40b8fcd8a9fbaf524f6dcdd83852b02) - Detect nested `dw.json` project roots in VS Code workspaces and allow nested folders to be pinned from Explorer, so parent-folder and multi-root layouts connect to the intended project. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#592](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/592) [`f6b4ced`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f6b4ced5d40b8fcd8a9fbaf524f6dcdd83852b02) - Treat activation of an already-active code version as success, preserve useful OCAPI fault details, and avoid redundant activation choices in VS Code. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- Updated dependencies [[`f6b4ced`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f6b4ced5d40b8fcd8a9fbaf524f6dcdd83852b02)]:

- [#579](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/579) [`17d8eba`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/17d8eba792ab02bd708a13b7ef6996cee22b2bed) - Prepare the VS Code extension for its 1.0 Marketplace launch with a public-facing README, feature tour, setup guidance, Marketplace installation instructions, and support links. Contributor build, test, and packaging instructions now live in `DEVELOPMENT.md`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#549](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/549) [`4f3ac11`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/4f3ac110ec5dc7364643bb1ff4d4c529c4f8cd63) - Point the extension's marketplace repository URL at `forcedotcom/b2c-dx`. The extension is published from a separate Salesforce-owned repository under open-source governance (public OSS lives under a `forcedotcom`/`salesforce` org); development, issues, and pull requests continue in this monorepo. See `packages/b2c-vs-extension/PUBLISHING.md` for the publish flow. (Thanks [@amit-kumar8-sf](https://github.com/amit-kumar8-sf)!)

## 1.0.1

The extension previously published with the default placeholder tile; it now ships a 256x256 branded icon (Salesforce cloud + B2C Commerce cart) via the top-level `icon` manifest field. (Thanks [@amit-kumar8-sf](https://github.com/amit-kumar8-sf)!)

### Minor Changes

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Surface **Custom Step Types** as a third category under each cartridge in the **Cartridges** explorer, alongside Hooks and Job Steps. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - Custom step types are parsed from any `steptypes.json` under the cartridge (both `script-module-step` and `chunk-script-module-step` categories are supported, and the legacy flat-array shape is tolerated).
  - **Clicking a step type opens its module implementation** (the `.js` file referenced by the `module` field) — resolving across sibling cartridges when the module lives in a different cartridge from where it's registered.
  - **Right-click → Show Step Type Definition** jumps to the `@type-id` line inside `steptypes.json` for the alternate navigation target.
  - Nodes for step types whose module cannot be resolved on disk fall back to opening the JSON definition, so the click always does something useful.

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add B2C-DX Analytics (CIP/CCAC) feature to the VS Code extension. Surfaces three webview panels: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - **Query Builder** — visual SELECT/FROM/WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT composer with raw-SQL toggle and a workspace-scoped Saved Queries library tagged per tenant.
  - **Tables Browser** — schema explorer for the active CIP warehouse tenant.
  - **Curated Reports** — parameter forms for every `cip report …` command with date pickers, validation, sortable result grid, and CSV/JSON export.

  Adds multi-realm management (group, add, edit, switch, remove) so a single workspace can target multiple tenants. CIP commands now route through `registerSafeCommand` so SafetyGuard policies are enforced and a `cipAnalytics` feature category is recorded by usage telemetry. The shared webview stylesheet is copied into `dist/cip-analytics/` at build time so the packaged extension no longer reaches into `src/` for runtime assets.

- [#559](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/559) [`91947b0`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/91947b0646c04007049ce2bc321ca2ac76aa7a2c) - The extension no longer activates on every VS Code startup. It now activates on demand when you open a B2C Commerce workspace (detected via `dw.json`, `.project`, `cartridge/*.properties`, or `commerce-app.json`), open a B2C view, or run a B2C command — reducing startup overhead in unrelated projects. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Adds an opt-in `b2c-dx.features.sandboxFilesystem` setting (default off) that automatically mounts the active instance's WebDAV filesystem as a workspace folder.

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add an interactive Export view to the VS Code extension for building site impex (site archive) exports. Check the data units you want — sites (with per-site flags), global data, catalogs, inventory lists, libraries, customer lists, and price books — then run Export to download and extract the archive locally. Sites, catalogs, and inventory lists are discovered from the instance automatically; libraries, customer lists, and price books are added by ID. The SDK gains a `discoverExportableUnits` helper that lists the exportable sites, catalogs, and inventory lists on an instance. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Improve ISML diagnostics and hover help: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - Add four diagnostics that catch common structural mistakes: `<iselse>`/`<iselseif>` outside an `<isif>`, `<isbreak>`/`<isnext>`/`<iscontinue>` outside an `<isloop>`, `<isreplace>` outside an `<isdecorate>`, and `<isprint>` setting both `style` and `formatter`.
  - The `encoding="off"` output-escaping warning (stored-XSS risk) is now on by default and fires for every tag with an `encoding` attribute (previously it was opt-in and only checked a subset of tags). Silence it per line with `<iscomment> b2c-dx-disable-next-line encoding-off </iscomment>` or globally via `b2c-dx.isml.diagnostics.disabledRules`.
  - Correct and expand tag hover text (fixes an inaccurate `<isscript>` tip, documents `<isloop>` status properties, `<isprint>` style/formatter, and `<iscontent>` placement).

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add ISML document formatting and expand ISML diagnostics. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  **Formatting.** ISML files now support Format Document and Format Selection, powered by the same engine as VS Code's built-in HTML formatter (`vscode-html-languageservice`). `<isscript>` bodies and `${...}` expressions are preserved verbatim, and void ISML tags are normalized to `<isxxx/>`. Configurable via `b2c-dx.isml.format.*` and gated by `b2c-dx.features.ismlFormatting`.

  **Diagnostics.** Added required-attribute checks (e.g. `<isif>` needs `condition`, `<isloop>` needs an iterator and an alias, `<isinclude>` needs `template` or `url`) and an opt-in `encoding="off"` output-escaping warning. Every diagnostic now carries a stable rule code shown in the Problems panel.

  **Suppression & configuration.** Individual lines can be suppressed inline with an ISML comment directive — `<iscomment> b2c-dx-disable-next-line <code> </iscomment>` (or `b2c-dx-disable-line`, or no code to suppress all rules on the line) — offered as a quick fix on any diagnostic. Rules can be disabled project-wide via `b2c-dx.isml.diagnostics.disabledRules` (the `encoding-off` warning is disabled by default).

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Highlight ISML tags (`<isif>`, `<isloop>`, `<isprint>`, `<isscript>`, etc.) distinctly from plain HTML tags so ISML directives are easier to spot at a glance. Controlled by the `b2c-dx.isml.highlightTags` setting (on by default); disable it to render ISML tags in the normal HTML tag color. The color follows the active theme and never modifies your settings. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

(Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Consolidate the B2C Operations (Jobs) experience into the primary **B2C-DX** sidebar based on review feedback: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - **Single Job History view** under the existing `b2c-dx` container (collapsed by default). The standalone "B2C-DX Operations" sidebar and the React-based Job History table webview have been removed — all controls now live in the tree's title bar.
  - **No fetch on activation.** The view shows a load hint until you press **Refresh** (or enable the new **Auto-Refresh** toggle). A new `b2c-dx.jobs.autoRefresh` setting (off by default) and a title-bar toggle control opt-in polling.
  - **Chronological-first root view.** Job History now defaults to a BM-style flat timeline of recent executions, with a title-bar toggle to switch to the previous "group by job" view. New `b2c-dx.jobs.defaultGrouping` setting controls the default.
  - **Default status filter is `all`**, fixing the empty-view-on-first-load defect (previously required clicking the filter before anything appeared).
  - **Inline name filter** in the title bar (BM-style job-name search).
  - **Open in Business Manager** deep-links directly to _Administration › Operations › Jobs_ instead of the BM landing page.
  - **Job Definitions view removed.** Its useful action — **Create Job Scaffold** — moves to a right-click on a cartridge in the **Cartridges** explorer.
  - **Cartridges explorer broadened** to expand each cartridge into **Hooks** and **Job Steps** child nodes (parsed from `hooks.json` and `cartridge/scripts/jobsteps/`). Click a file to open it.

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add a B2C Operations (Jobs) experience to the VS Code extension: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - **Job History** — view execution history from the connected instance, including jobs that are currently running (shown live with a spinner and auto-refresh), with a table to search, filter (status, job, user, date, time presets), sort, and export runs to CSV/JSON. Each run has inline actions to open its log, view details, and re-run.
  - **Job Definitions** — view the jobs (`jobs.xml`) and custom step types (`steptypes.json`) defined in your workspace cartridges, with actions to run, deploy, and open the source files.
  - **Run / Re-run** — trigger a job (optionally with parameters), poll it to completion, and open its log automatically. Re-run reuses the original execution's parameters.
  - **Create Job Scaffold** — generate a custom job step script, its `steptypes.json` registration, and a matching `jobs.xml` that references the registered `custom.*` step type.
  - **Deploy Job Definition** — deploy a `jobs.xml` to register the job in Business Manager.

  System (`sfcc-*`) jobs are distinguished from custom jobs, and actions that don't apply to them are disabled with an explanation.

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Add XSD-based validation, autocomplete, and hover docs for B2C metadata XML files, backed by ~50 bundled schemas (catalogs, promotions, jobs, services, A/B tests, page-meta-tags, sorting rules, source codes, content libraries, event routing, and more). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  **Namespace-based association.** Validation is matched by the document's declared XML namespace, not by filename or folder layout, so a metadata file validates against the correct schema wherever it lives — in a canonical site-archive (`sites/<id>/…`), an exploded `metadata/` workspace, or anywhere else. The extension ships an XML catalog and registers it with the Red Hat XML language server at runtime; no changes are written to your `settings.json`.

  **Optional companion extension.** Validation is powered by the Red Hat XML extension (`redhat.vscode-xml`), a _soft_ dependency — it is not force-installed and no Java runtime is required. When you open a B2C metadata XML file, the extension offers to install it (with a "Don't ask again" option); until then the extension is unaffected. You can trigger setup any time via the **B2C DX: Set Up Metadata XML Validation** command, and disable the whole feature with the `b2c-dx.features.xmlValidation` setting. Teams whose policies block third-party extensions can simply decline the prompt.

### Patch Changes

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Fix the VS Code extension failing to activate when ISML support is enabled. The `src/isml/scanner.ts` module loaded `vscode-html-languageservice` via runtime `require()` calls that esbuild left unbundled. Because the VSIX is packaged with `vsce --no-dependencies`, the deep submodule paths could not be resolved at runtime and activation crashed silently — no "B2C DX" output channel, no instance selector, no commands. Switched to direct ESM imports so esbuild inlines the scanner code into the bundle. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#565](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/565) [`54d69bc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/54d69bc3e439d0252f6a1456e9aa8a307e7a2767) - Harden ISML language support: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - Treat `<isslot>`, `<ismodule>`, and `<iscomponent>` as empty (self-closing) elements, so auto-close no longer inserts invalid closing tags and diagnostics no longer report them as "not closed".
  - Ignore markup inside `<iscomment>` and `<isscript>` bodies — commented-out ISML and `<` characters in scripts no longer produce false diagnostics, folding, or symbols.
  - Debounce diagnostics so large templates are not re-linted on every keystroke.
  - Guard the "create template" command against being run directly from the command palette.
  - Resolve template links without the `vscode-html-languageservice` dependency, removing a fragile deep import into that package's internals.

The guided walkthrough, role-based deep-dive panel, and their palette commands no longer appear — and the walkthrough no longer auto-opens on first activation — unless the setting is enabled. Set `b2c-dx.features.onboarding` to `true` to opt in while the feature is still in development. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

A malformed `dw.json` no longer prevents the extension from activating, so local code browsing — cartridge discovery, Script API IntelliSense, cartridge-path require resolution, CAP detection, and scaffolding — keeps working without a connection. Connection-dependent views (WebDAV, Content, Sandbox, Logs) now collapse repeated "instance unreachable" errors into a single notification instead of flooding, and the Sandbox view explains when Account Manager OAuth credentials are the missing piece. The SDK's `listInstances()` now tolerates a malformed `dw.json` (returning no instances) rather than throwing. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

The packaged VSIX no longer includes the `test-workspace/` sample cartridges or local `.claude/` editor settings, reducing package size and removing files that were never meant to ship. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Log entries are now color-coded by level (error, warn, info, debug) with a built-in level filter, each entry is tagged with its source log prefix (e.g. `[error]`, `[customerror]`), and multi-line stack traces are indented so each entry reads as a single block.

Previously these failure events carried no error detail, which made it impossible to diagnose why a tool call or activation failed. No new data beyond the error text is collected, matching what the CLI already reports for command errors. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

This removes ~270 transitive packages (the OpenTelemetry, Azure SDK, and gRPC trees that the v3 SDK pulled in for auto-collection features we never used) and shrinks the published packages and the VS Code extension bundle. Telemetry behavior is unchanged — the same events and exceptions are reported — and the machine-identifying cloud role instance is now correctly suppressed for GDPR. A new optional `flushIntervalMs` option enables periodic delivery for long-lived hosts; the VS Code extension uses it so a session's usage events are not lost on a non-clean shutdown. No public SDK API change. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Custom APIs now show endpoint paths with the required `/organizations/{organizationId}/...` prefix, and the Shopper/Admin classification is now derived from the spec's declared security schemes (ShopperToken / AmOAuth2 / BearerToken) rather than the API family name — fixing token selection for shopper-named APIs that live under non-shopper families (e.g. `product/shopper-products`, `checkout/shopper-baskets`) and for Custom APIs which can be either type. Resolves #453. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#475](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/475) [`0363dca`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/0363dca90f1eb3822d0c750d29ace743e82afcaf) - Harden the extension build and packaging pipeline. The esbuild bundle now minifies, drops debugger statements, targets Node 22 (matching VS Code 1.105's runtime), and inlines `require('@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk/package.json')` at SDK source-load time so minification can no longer break the substitution. SDK data directories that the runtime expects (`cip-proto`, `script-api`, `content-schemas`, `scaffolds`) are all staged into `dist/data/` instead of just `scaffolds`. The `inject-script-types` step that adds the bundled TypeScript Server plugin to the VSIX now uses pure-Node JSZip instead of shelling out to `zip`/`unzip`, removing the host-binary requirement (Windows CI compatibility) and fixing a regression where `[Content_Types].xml` entries for the injected plugin were emitted without their leading dot. The extension version and telemetry connection string are now injected as build-time constants, eliminating a runtime `readFileSync(package.json)`. `vscode:prepublish` now builds `@salesforce/b2c-script-types` before the extension bundle so a stale plugin tree can no longer ship. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#475](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/475) [`0363dca`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/0363dca90f1eb3822d0c750d29ace743e82afcaf) - Correctness and UX hardening pass across the extension: (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
  - **Content libraries**: `ContentFileSystemProvider.stat()` now returns a stable `mtime` instead of `Date.now()` per call. VS Code no longer believes content files are constantly mutating, eliminating phantom "file modified externally" prompts and silent buffer reloads that could clobber unsaved edits.
  - **WebDAV explorer**: F2-rename now works. The `rename()` method delegates to the SDK's `webdav.move` (already used by drag-and-drop) instead of throwing `NoPermissions`. Cross-root attempts and 412 conflicts are mapped to the right `vscode.FileSystemError`.
  - **Activation performance**: replaced sync `fs.readFileSync` / `existsSync` / `statSync` on the activation hot path (`B2CExtensionConfig`) and in the per-paint CAP file-decoration provider with `vscode.workspace.fs` async equivalents and a Set lookup, respectively. CAP decorations now answer in O(1) without filesystem syscalls.
  - **Cancellation**: long-running operations (sandbox clone polling, CAP install, deploy, content export, Swagger UI proxy fetches) now show a working Cancel button. Cancelling stops the local poll/wait; aborting the server-side operation requires SDK `AbortSignal` support which is a separate change.
  - **Tree state stability**: every tree provider (sandbox, WebDAV, content libraries, API browser, cartridges) now sets a stable `TreeItem.id`, so expand/collapse state survives refresh and `treeView.reveal()` works without try/catch fallback.
  - **Safety + telemetry coverage**: 11 contributed commands previously bypassed `registerSafeCommand`, including `b2c-dx.sandbox.clone` (a billable operation). All now route through the safety guard and feature-usage telemetry. Added a `scriptTypes` feature category and command-prefix mapping.
  - **Dead code removal**: removed an unused `createDeleteAndDeployCommand`, the unused `tempDirs` cleanup loop in `cartridge-commands`, the dead `openExternal` branch in the Page Designer webview message handler, and the never-implemented `b2c-dx.codeSync.diffCartridge` command.

The VS Code extension wires this up out of the box; for other editors, run `b2c setup ide tsserver-plugin` (LSP plugin) or `b2c setup ide vscode-types` (jsconfig). See the IDE Integration guide for details. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

### Patch Changes

- [#425](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/425) [`5e43132`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/5e43132ab1b10da33517a697b32e22737d2f9bb4) - The SDK is now ESM-only — the dual-format `dist/cjs` build has been removed and the package exports map exposes only ESM. CommonJS consumers that previously did `require('@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk')` from a CJS package must either switch to `import` or rely on Node's `require(esm)` (Node ≥22.12). The VS Code extension has been converted to a `"type": "module"` package; its bundled entry is now `dist/extension.cjs`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

### Minor Changes

- [#422](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/422) [`e4b8238`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/e4b82385bfddb93a17f874f34315e4ab73e7c84a) - The `libraries` config field now accepts `{id, siteLibrary?}` objects in addition to bare strings (mixed forms allowed in the same array). This lets you mark site-private libraries in `dw.json` or `package.json` so `b2c content list` / `content export` can default `--site-library` based on which library you target, and the VS Code Content Libraries tree auto-loads every configured library on activation. To upgrade, optionally replace `"libraries": ["RefArchSharedLibrary"]` with `"libraries": ["RefArchSharedLibrary", {"id": "SiteGenesis", "siteLibrary": true}]`. The existing string-only form continues to work unchanged. Also adds `libraries`, `assetQuery`, and `realm` to the documented `package.json` allowed fields list (already supported in code). (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#409](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/409) [`ec31234`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/ec312342e14080fb5d51b72243e763030c429f80) - Add anonymous usage telemetry (extension activation/deactivation lifecycle, broad feature-category usage, exceptions) to help prioritize fixes during the Developer Preview. Sending is non-blocking. Honors the new `b2c-dx.telemetry.enabled` setting (default `true`), VS Code's `telemetry.telemetryLevel`, and the `SFCC_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` / `SF_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variables. No credentials, hostnames, or business data are collected. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Set it in `dw.json` (per-instance), in `package.json` under `b2c`, or via `SFCC_ASSET_QUERY` to control which JSON dot-paths are extracted as assets during content library parsing. The VS Code Content Libraries tree and `b2c content export` both honor it automatically; the `--asset-query` flag still wins when provided, and the fallback remains `["image.path"]`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

Destructive operations initiated from the extension (sandbox delete/stop/restart, WebDAV writes, jobs, etc.) now honor `SFCC_SAFETY_LEVEL`, `SFCC_SAFETY_CONFIRM`, `SFCC_SAFETY_CONFIG`, and the per-instance `safety` block in `dw.json`, consistent with the CLI. Every extension command is also evaluated against command rules (e.g. `{ "command": "b2c-dx.sandbox.delete", "action": "block" }`), and confirmation-mode policies surface a native VS Code modal before the command runs. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  - Swagger API Browser webview no longer attempts `postMessage` after the panel has been disposed (previously could throw on token refresh or proxy responses arriving after close).
  - Sandbox tree polling no longer stacks "stop-check" timers when the configured polling interval is shorter than the 3-second stabilization window.
  - Code Sync now drains pending uploads/deletes before tearing down its file watchers, so saves immediately preceding a stop are no longer dropped.

(Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  New commands:
  - `b2c cap validate` — validates CAP structure, manifest, and cartridge rules locally
  - `b2c cap package` — packages a CAP directory into a distributable `.zip`
  - `b2c cap install` — installs a CAP on an instance via WebDAV + `sfcc-install-commerce-app` job
  - `b2c cap uninstall` — uninstalls a CAP via `sfcc-uninstall-commerce-app` job

  New SDK exports in `@salesforce/b2c-tooling-sdk/operations/cap`: `validateCap`, `commerceAppInstall`, `commerceAppUninstall`, `commerceAppPackage`.

  The VS Code extension gains CAP directory detection (badge decoration) and an "Install Commerce App (CAP)" context menu action.

description: Deploy, download, and manage cartridge code versions on B2C Commerce instances. Use this skill whenever the user needs to upload or download cartridges to/from a sandbox, activate or delete code versions, watch for local file changes during development, or deploy a subset of cartridges. Also use when pushing code to an instance, pulling code from an instance, or setting up a dev workflow with live reload -- even if they just say 'push my code to the sandbox', 'download the code', or 'how do I activate the new version'.

# B2C Code Skill

Use the `b2c` CLI to deploy, download, and manage code versions on Salesforce B2C Commerce instances.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli code deploy`).

## Configuration & Authentication

The CLI auto-discovers the target instance and credentials from `SFCC_*` environment variables, `dw.json` in the current or parent directories, `~/.mobify`, `package.json`, and configuration plugins. **Flags like `--server`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`, `--username`, and `--password` are usually unnecessary** — only pass them to override what's auto-detected.

Run `b2c setup inspect` to see the resolved configuration and which source provided each value (use `--json` for scripting, `--unmask` to reveal secrets). For precedence rules and troubleshooting, see the `b2c-cli:b2c-config` skill.

## Examples

### Deploy Cartridges

```bash
# deploy all cartridges from current directory
b2c code deploy

# deploy cartridges from a specific directory
b2c code deploy ./my-cartridges

# deploy to a specific server and code version
b2c code deploy --server my-sandbox.demandware.net --code-version v1

# deploy and reload (re-activate) the code version
b2c code deploy --reload

# delete existing cartridges before upload and reload
b2c code deploy --delete --reload

# deploy only specific cartridges
b2c code deploy -c app_storefront_base -c plugin_applepay

# exclude specific cartridges from deployment
b2c code deploy -x test_cartridge
```

### Download Cartridges

```bash
# download all cartridges from the active code version
b2c code download

# download to a specific directory
b2c code download -o ./downloaded

# download from a specific server and code version
b2c code download --server my-sandbox.demandware.net --code-version v1

# download only specific cartridges
b2c code download -c app_storefront_base -c plugin_applepay

# exclude specific cartridges from download
b2c code download -x test_cartridge

# mirror: extract to local cartridge project locations
b2c code download --mirror
```

### Watch for Changes

```bash
# watch cartridges and upload changes automatically
b2c code watch

# watch a specific directory
b2c code watch ./my-cartridges

# watch with specific server and code version
b2c code watch --server my-sandbox.demandware.net --code-version v1

# watch only specific cartridges
b2c code watch -c app_storefront_base

# watch excluding specific cartridges
b2c code watch -x test_cartridge
```

### List Code Versions

```bash
# list code versions on the instance
b2c code list

# list with JSON output
b2c code list --json
```

### Activate Code Version

```bash
# activate a code version
b2c code activate <version-name>

# reload (re-activate) the current code version
b2c code activate --reload
```

**Note:** Activation is idempotent. If the version is already active, the command succeeds without making a change. If you've uploaded code or changed Custom APIs in the active version, use `--reload` with deploy or activate to force a refresh and register the endpoints. Check registration status with the `b2c-cli:b2c-scapi-custom` skill.

### Delete Code Version

```bash
# delete a code version
b2c code delete <version-name>
```

### More Commands

See `b2c code --help` for a full list of available commands and options in the `code` topic.

> **Note:** `b2c code deploy` uploads cartridge *code* to an instance. To manage which cartridges are *active on a site* (the cartridge path), see the `b2c-cli:b2c-sites` skill for the `b2c sites cartridges` commands.
